      A circus performer as a kid and a pirate as a teengaer, Casmey is now a reluctant adult looking for a
      new adventure. That shouldn't be hard though -- she's always been quite talented at finding trouble. Since her days
      on the trapeze, she's been most comfortable perched in precarious situations, where a tiny mistake
      leads to a painful fall. When she does fall -- and she has many times -- she tends
      to land on her feet, ready to climb back up.

      A precocious young wizard, Sanson hungers for the power to change the world for the better. After
      the unexpected death of his younger sister, he started to wonder how so much tragedy can befall
      the world when the power of magic to do good is so great? He studies hard with the singular purpose
      to wield magic with such power and finesse to shape the world to his own morality. The cost of his
      focus are often things unaffected by magic such as friendships, health, and learned wisdom.
