- name: Casmey Dalseya
  description: >
    An acrobat as a kid and a pirate as a young adult, Casmey is looking for a new adventure. That
    shouldn't be hard though. She's always been quite talented at finding trouble. She feels
    most relaxed in precarious situations, where one mistake means a long fall. And even when she
    has fallen, she's always landed on her feet, already looking back up.
