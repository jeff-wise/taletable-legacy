- name: Village Guard 1
  type: Common
  description: >
    He patrols the streets of the town, making small talk with the familiar townspeople and
    shopkeepers while keeping a vigilant eye on any out-of-towners. He likes to make jokes about
    how nothing ever happens and about how he has the easiest job in the kingdom. He's not
    particularly observant. He was a soldier for a short time but was injured from tripping over
    his own spear and was sent back to be a guard.

  type: Common
  description: >
    She was always a fighter, even since she was a kid. She bested all all her male peers with the
    sword. Though instead of earning respect, she got resentment and sneers. She never felt like
    she belonged. When she was 14 she ran away to join the army, but she was rejected because they
    only accepted men. Out of money and hope, she returned to the village and took this job. She
    still waits for that chance that will come one day for a real adventure, a chance to prove
    herself.
