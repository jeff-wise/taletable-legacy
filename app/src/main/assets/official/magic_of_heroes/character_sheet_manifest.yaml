- name: Casmey Dalseya
  description: >
    An acrobat as a kid and a pirate as a young adult, Casmey is looking for a new adventure. That
    shouldn't be hard though -- she's always been quite talented at finding trouble. Since her days
    on the trapeze, she has always felt most relaxed perched in precarious situations where any
    mistakes is rewarded with a long fall. Though even when she falls, she tends to land on her
    feet, ready to climb back up.
