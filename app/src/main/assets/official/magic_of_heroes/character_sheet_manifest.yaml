  description: >
    An acrobat as a kid and a pirate as a young adult, Casmey is looking for a new adventure. That
    shouldn't be hard though -- she's always been quite talented at finding trouble. Since her days
    on the trapeze, she has always felt most relaxed perched in precarious situations where any
    mistake is rewarded with a long fall. When she does fall -- and she has many times -- she tends
    to land on her feet, ready to climb back up.
