        They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc
        curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so on.

        A rapier is a slender sword that ends in a sharp point. It is primarily designed for
        thrusting, though there are variants which may be used effectively for slashing or
        cutting. A light and nimble weapon, it is often utilizized in situations where speed and
        finesse are major factors and where heavier blades may be comparitively clumsy.

#      body: >
#        As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of
#        you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a

#        On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage.
#    - id: alchemists_fire
#      title: Alchemist's Fire
#      body: >

#        this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a
#        creature or object, treating the alchemist's fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit,
#        the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end
#        this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.

#    - id: arcane_focus
#      title: Arcane Focus
#      body: >
#        An arcane focus is a special item--an orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed
#        staff, a wand-like length of wood, or some similar item--designed to channel the power
#        of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a
#        spellcasting focus.

#      title: Ball Bearings
#      body: >
#        As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level,
#        square area that is 10 feet on a side. A creature moving across the covered area must
#        succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature moving through the
#        area at half speed doesn't need to make the saveSheet.
#    - id: block_and_tackle
#      title: Block and Tackle
#      body: >

#      body: >
#        As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on
#        a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw
#        or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the
#        creature's walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point.
#        A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the saveSheet.

#      body: >
#        A climber's kit includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use
#        the climber's kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can't fall more

#        25 feet away from that point without undoing the anchor.
#    - id: component_pouch
#      title: Component Pouch
#      body: >
#        A component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to
#        hold all the material components and other special items you need to cast your spells,

#        yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole out of a living tree, or a totem
#        object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals. A druid

#    - id: fishing_tackle
#      title: Fishing Tackle

#    - id: holy_symbol
#      title: Holy Symbol
#      body: >
#        A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting
#        a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem
#        on a shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic. A cleric or paladin can
#        use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must
#        hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield.
#    - id: holy_water
#      title: Holy Water
#      body: >
#        As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of
#        you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged
#        attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If
#        the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage.
#        A cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing a special ritual. The ritual
#        takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster
#        to expend a 1st-level spell slot.
#    - id: hunting_trap
#      title: Hunting Trap
#      body: >
#        When you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps
#        shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a
#        heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A
#        creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take
#        1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the
#        trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A
#        creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another
#        creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to
#        the trapped creature.
#    - id: lamp
#      title: Lamp

#    - id: lock
#      title: Lock
#      body: >
#        A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves'

#    - id: magnifying_glass
#      title: Magnifying Glass
#      body: >
#        This lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for
#        flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires
#        light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire
#        to ignite. A magnifying glass grants advantage on any ability check made to appraise or
#        inspect an item that is small or highly detailed.
#    - id: manacles
#      title: Manacles
#      body: >

#        requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20
#        Strength check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature
#        proficient with thieves' tools can pick the manacles' lock with a successful DC 15
#        Dexterity check. Manacles have 15 hit points.
#    - id: mess_kit

#    - id: oil
#      title: Oil
#      body: >
#        Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil
#        in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering
#        it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil
#        as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any
#        fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire
#        damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a
#        5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2
#        rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in
#        the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.
#    - id: poison_basic

#        A monsterâ€™s **challenge rating** tells you how great a threat the monster is. An appropriately equipped and well-rested party of four adventurers should be able to defeat a monster that has a challenge rating equal to its level without suffering any deaths. For example, a party of four 3rd-level characters should find a monster with a challenge rating of 3 to be a worthy challenge, but not a deadly one.
#
#        Monsters that are significantly weaker than 1st-level characters have a challenge rating lower than 1. Monsters with a challenge rating of 0 are insignificant except in large numbers; those with no effective attacks are worth no experience points, while those that have attacks are worth 10 XP each.
#
#        Some monsters present a greater challenge than even a typical 20th-level party can handle. These monsters have a challenge rating of 21 or higher and are specifically designed to test player skill.
#
#        ### Experience Points
#
#        The number of experience points (XP) a monster is worth is based on its challenge rating. Typically, XP is awarded for defeating the monster, although the GM may also award XP for neutralizing the threat posed by the monster in some other manner.
#
#        Unless something tells you otherwise, a monster summoned by a spell or other magical ability is worth the XP noted in its stat block.
