        The player character ancestries presented in this book are dwarves, elves, gnomes, goblins, halflings, and humans (including the half-human groups of half- elves and half-orcs). These ancestries are each detailed on the following pages of this chapter.


        Your character also has a background that represents the training or environments she experienced as a youth. This could include time spent working as an acrobat, a barkeep, or a farmhand, or an upbringing like that of a noble, a nomad, or a scholar. Your character’s background affords her extra ability boosts as well as other benefits, such as a feat and training in one Lore skill. The list of character backgrounds begins on page 38 in this chapter.


        A character has one ancestry and one background, both of which you select during character creation. Once chosen, your ancestry and background can’t be changed.

        This section presents ancestry feats, which allow you to customize your character. You gain your first ancestry feat at 1st level, and another at 5th level, 9th level, 13th level, and 17th level, as indicated in the class advancement table in the descriptions of each class (see page 42).

        Some of the feats in this section are marked with symbols that denote how you can use them during play. Full rules for actions, activities, free actions, and reactions can be found on page 296.

        Ancestry feats list a number on the same line as the feat’s name, indicating the minimum level your character must be to select the feat. In most cases, ancestry feats are labeled with “Feat 1,” meaning that your character can select the feat at 1st level or anytime you gain an ancestry feat thereafter. Ancestry feats also sometimes list prerequisites—these are additional requirements that your character must fulfill before she can select that feat.

        All ancestry feats have a trait that indicates which ancestry they belong to.

        The dwarves’ ancient surface empire fell long ago, overwhelmed by orc and goblinoid enemies, but dwarves today retain many of the qualities that propelled their people to greatness in ancient times: fierceness, gumption, and stubbornness in endeavors ranging from battle and craftsmanship to forging ties with family and friends. Dwarves are slow to trust people who are not their kin—a tendency that traces to their history of bloody conflict with foes such as giants, orcs, and the horrors of the deeps. Trust from a dwarf is hard won, but as strong as iron.

        These sturdy people stand about a foot shorter than most humans. Long hair is often a source of pride among them, particularly when braided into intricate patterns. Men are typically broader than women, and many men take pride in their long beards. Dwarves typically reach physical adulthood around the age of 25 and can live to around 350 years old.

        The distance between dwarven mountain citadels creates vast cultural divides, but many dwarves share a common passion for architecture, gem cutting, metalwork, mining, and stonework. Dwarves revere honor, justice, and the traditions of their clans and kingdoms. Few dwarves are seen without a clan dagger, a weapon forged just before an individual dwarf’s birth and bearing the gemstone of the clan.

        Your dwarven build allows you to push foes around. Take a Step into the square of a foe that is your size or smaller, and the foe must move into the empty space directly behind it. The foe must move even if doing so places it in harm’s way. The foe can attempt to block your Step by rolling a Fortitude saving throw against your Athletics DC. If the foe attempts this saving throw, regardless of the saving throw’s result, the creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to your level plus your Strength modifier.


        If the foe can’t move into an empty space (if it is surrounded by solid objects or other creatures, for example), your Boulder Roll has no effect.

When you take the Step action, you can ignore difficult terrain caused by uneven ground made of stone and earth. In addition, when you use the Acrobatics skill to Balance (see page 144) on narrow surfaces or uneven ground made of stone or earth, you aren’t flat-footed, and you treat a success on the Acrobatics check as if it were a critical success.

        You have a knack for noticing inconsistencies and craftsmanship techniques in the stonework around you. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to notice unusual stonework. This bonus applies to checks to discover mechanical traps made of stone or hidden inside of stone. If you aren’t using the Seek action (see page 308) or searching, the GM rolls a secret check without the bonus and with a –2 circumstance penalty for you to notice unusual stonework anyway (in such cases, this feat takes on the secret trait).

        Elves combine an otherworldly grace, sharp intellect, and mysterious charm in a way that is practically magnetic to members of other ancestries. They are often voraciously intellectual, though they fill their long years with complicated pedagogies that most shorter-lived peoples find inefficient. Elves also hold notoriously long grudges against their rivals, but these antagonistic relationships can sometimes blossom into friendship over time.

        Elves are generally taller than humans, and they have a fragile grace accentuated with long facial features and sharply pointed ears. Broad pupils fill their wide eyes, giving elves an alien look and allowing them to see sharply even in very little light. Elves typically reach physical adulthood around the age of 20 (though they’re considered by other elves to be fully emotionally mature at close to the end of their first century), and they can live to around 600 years old.

        Elves subtly and deeply attune to their environment and their companions, and they often take on physical traits reflecting their surroundings. An elf who has dwelled in primeval forests for centuries, for example, might exhibit verdant hair and gnarled fingers, while one who’s lived in a desert might have golden pupils and skin.

        Elves are often emotional and capricious, yet they also value kindness and beauty.

        Always hungry for new experiences, gnomes constantly wander both mentally and physically, attempting to stave off a terrible ailment that threatens all of their people. This affliction—the Bleaching—strikes gnomes who fail to dream, innovate, and take in new experiences as their progenitors did every hour of every day in the First World. The Bleaching slowly drains the literal color from gnomes, and it plunges the affected into states of deep depression that eventually claim their lives. Only a very few gnomes survive this scourge, becoming deeply morose and wise survivors known as bleachlings.

        Most gnomes stand just over 3 feet tall and weigh little more than a young human child. Gnomes reach physical adulthood around the age of 18, though many retain a childlike curiosity even into adulthood. Gnomes rarely live longer than 400 years.

        Though they all trace their ancestry to the First World, gnomes otherwise have little culture they point to as their own. Instead, gnomes tend to pick and choose cultural practices of the region in which they live. Gnomes claim no nation in its entirety, and as a people they wouldn’t know what to do with such a state if one existed. Most gnomes consider adventure not a choice but a necessity, and gnome adventurers often collect mementos during their travels that allow them to relive their most exciting stories.

        Even those goblins who break from their destructive past often subtly perpetuate some of the qualities that have been tied to the creatures for millennia. Goblins tend to flock to strong leaders, fiercely protecting those companions who have protected them from physical harm or offered a sympathetic ear when they learn of the goblins’ woes. Some goblins remain deeply fascinated with fire, or fearlessly devour a meal that might turn others’ stomachs. Others are endless tinkerers and view their companions’ trash simply as components of gadgets yet to be made. Occasionally, fellow adventurers find these proclivities unsettling or odd, but more often than not, goblins’ friends consider these qualities endearing.

        Though goblins’ culture has splintered radically, their reputation across the Inner Sea region has changed little. As such, goblins who travel to larger cities are frequently subjected to derision, and as a result many goblins work twice as hard at proving their worth. Those who befriend a goblin quickly learn that while a goblin’s friendship might include all manners of pranks, such fun comes from a place of true acceptance—something that a goblin does not give freely.

        Goblins reach adolescence by the age of 3 and adulthood 4 or 5 years later. In theory, goblins could live 50 years or more, but without anyone to protect them from each other or themselves, few live past 20 years of age. Goblins typically stand about 3 feet tall, with skin colors that range from green to gray to blue.

        Taller folk rarely pay attention to the shadows at Goblin their feet, and you take full advantage of this. You can move 5 feet farther when you take the Sneak action, up to your Speed (see page 158).


        In addition, if you critically succeed at a Stealth check against a creature and then attack that creature, your target remains flat-footed during your attack. The GM doesn’t reveal that your Stealth check resulted in a critical success until you declare your attack.

        Many taller people dismiss halflings due to their size or, worse still, treat them like children. Halflings use these misconceptions and prejudices to their advantage, gaining access to opportunities and performing deeds of daring mischief or heroism. A halfling’s curiosity is tempered with caution, often leading to narrow escapes.

        Despite their jovial and friendly nature, halflings don’t naturally tend to congregate together. They have no cultural homeland, and they instead weave themselves throughout the world’s societies. Halflings usually dwell among humans within the walls of cities, eking out whatever livings they can, many performing menial labor or simple service jobs. Some halflings reject such a life, instead turning to the open road, traveling from place to place in search of fortune and fame. These nomadic halflings often travel in small groups, sharing hardships and simple pleasures among close friends and family.

        Halflings rarely grow to more than 3 feet in height. Tufts of hair warm the tops of their broad, tanned feet, and they prefer to walk barefoot. Halflings typically reach physical adulthood at the age of 20. A typical halfling can live to around 150 years old. Halflings are loyal to their friends and family, but they are not afraid to do what needs to be done in order to survive.

        Halflings’ wanderlust and opportunism make them ideal adventurers, and one popular superstition even claims that traveling with a halfling is good luck.

        Humans’ empires and nations are vast, sprawling things, and their citizens carve names for themselves with the strength of their sword arms and the power of their spells. Humanity is both diverse and tumultuous, running the gamut from cruel to kind, from sinister to saintlike. And while humans build large nation states and free cities alike, many of them venture forth to explore, leaving their homes to map uncharted realms, search for long-lost treasure, or lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors for no better reason than because they can.

        Human variety also manifests in their governments, attitudes, and social norms. Though the oldest of human cultures trace their histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to the societies of the elves or dwarves, human civilizations seem to be in a constant state of flux, as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old.

        Humans typically reach physical adulthood at the age of 18. A typical human can live to be around 90 years old. Humans often intermarry with other peoples, giving rise to children who bear traits of both parents. The most notable half-humans are half-elves and half-orcs. Humans worship a wide range of gods and practice many different religions.

        For many humans, adventuring serves as a means to an end, whether that end is accumulating wealth, striving for acclaim, increasing in social status, or uncovering arcane knowledge and power.

        A half-elf is born to an elf and a human, or to two half- elves. The life of a half-elf can be difficult, marked by a struggle to fit in. Half-elves don’t have their own homeland on Golarion, nor are populations of half-elves particularly tied to one another, since they often have very disparate human and elven heritages. Instead, most half-elves attempt to find acceptance in either human or elven settlements.


        Half-elves often appear primarily human, with subtly pointed ears and a taller stature than most full-blooded humans. Half-elves lack the almost alien eyes of their elf parents, though they do carry a natural presence— and often a striking beauty—that leads many to become artists or entertainers. Despite this innate appeal, many half-elves have difficulty forming lasting bonds with humans or elves due to the disconnection they feel from both peoples as a whole.

        Half-elves live longer than other humans, often reaching an age around 150 years. This causes some of them to fear friendship and romance with humans, knowing that they’ll likely outlive their companions.

          A half-orc is the offspring of a human and an orc, or in some cases, the offspring of two half-orcs. Because some bigoted humans see orcs as more akin to creatures than people, they sometimes hate and fear half-orcs simply due to their lineage. This commonly pushes half-orcs to the margins of society, where some find work in drudgery or as mercenaries, and others tragically fall into crime or cruelty. Many who can’t stand the indignities heaped on them in human society find a home among their orc kin or trek out into the wilderness to live in peace.


          Humans often assume half-orcs are unintelligent or uncivilized, and half-orcs rarely find acceptance among societies with a large concentration of such folk. To an orc tribe, a half-orc is considered intelligent enough to make a good war leader but weaker than the other orcs. Consequently, many half-orcs end up having low status among orc tribes unless they can prove their strength.

          A half-orc has a shorter lifespan than other humans, living to be roughly 70 years old.

        Study of multiple magical traditions reveals how to alter a spell to suit your spellcasting style. Choose one cantrip from a spell list other than your own. If you have a spell repertoire or spellbook, replace one of the cantrips you know or have in your spellbook with the chosen spell. If you prepare spells without a spellbook (if you’re a cleric or druid, for example), one of your cantrips must always be the chosen spell, and you prepare the rest normally.


        If you swap or retrain this cantrip later, you can choose its replacement from the same alternate list or a different one. For more about magic and spells, see page 192.

        Your powerful ego makes it harder for others to order you around. If you succeed at a saving throw against a mental effect that attempts to directly control your actions, you critically succeed instead. If a creature fails to Coerce you using the Intimidation skill (see page 150), it treats the result as a critical failure instead (so it can’t try to Coerce you again for 1 week).

        Your character’s ancestry section states which languages she speaks at 1st level. Having an Intelligence score of 14 or higher also grants one additional language, which you can choose from the list presented in your character’s ancestry entry and from those available from your region or ethnicity.

        The languages presented in this section are grouped according to how commonly they are found throughout the Inner Sea region. Languages that are common are regularly found in most places, even among those who aren’t native speakers. Languages that are uncommon are most frequently spoken by native speakers, but they are also spoken by certain scholars and others interested in those associated cultures.

        Pathfinder also includes Druidic, which is a secret language. Druidic is not available to characters who are not druids, and druids are prohibited from teaching the language to nondruids, as described further on page 81.


        It is, of course, possible for your character to learn languages later in her adventuring career. The Multilingual feat (see page 169), for example, grants two new languages that can be chosen from the languages listed in the common and uncommon tables below. Other abilities and effects might grant access to common or uncommon languages as detailed in their descriptions.

        Your character might use sign language instead of spoken language. This is especially common for a character who is deaf or hard of hearing or who can’t speak. In this case, your character can communicate using the sign languages associated with the languages she selects, as well as being able to read and write the written forms of those languages.


        When you first choose your character’s languages, you must decide whether she knows the sign language versions of all of her languages or their spoken versions. If you choose sign language instead of spoken language, your character receives Read Lips (see page 170) as a bonus feat. However, if your character is unable to speak, that feat may not convey the ability to speak. A deaf or hard of hearing character can’t use hearing as an imprecise sense (see page 301). Should your character lose or gain her sense of hearing during the game, she can spend downtime retraining her languages from spoken to signed or vice versa. If you’re playing a hearing character who would know one or more sign languages as a result of her backstory (for example, a hearing character with a deaf parent), you may get Sign Language (see page 171) as a bonus feat at the GM’s discretion.


        Sign languages typically require both hands to convey more than basic concepts, and they require direct visual attention to understand. Since they are quiet, they are ideal for infiltrations in exploration mode, but the required attention makes them extremely difficult to understand in combat. Much as a character can’t engage in complex spoken dialogue while swinging a sword, a character can’t communicate a hefty amount of information in sign language during combat, but simple concepts such as designating a target, mocking a foe, or signaling an ally to look out can be conveyed through signs as easily as shouted words. Using sign language in some situations, such as areas of low visibility, can be tricky—just as it can be difficult to communicate verbally in a noisy environment.

        Learning a new language affords your character opportunities, particularly if you choose a language to fit the adventure, such as learning Undercommon before an adventure in the Darklands. While in most cases you can eventually find an NPC who also speaks Common, knowing the language yourself allows you to hear what the NPCs are saying to each other and appeal to NPCs other than your translator. Your whole party could even learn a little-known language that you use for secret communications!
