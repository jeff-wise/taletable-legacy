        Some abilities require a degree of training but can be learned by anyone, not only members of certain ancestries or classes. These abilities are called general feats. For most classes, you gain a general feat when you reach 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter. You can select any feat whose prerequisites you satisfy. General feats also include skill feats, which expand on what you can accomplish via skills. Most characters gain skill feats at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter; see your class for details.

        You can spend the day Gathering Information specifically about deals on items rather than other information. Name an item or a general category of items (such as “magic weapons”) you’re looking for and then roll your Diplomacy check. Any bonuses you have when Gathering Information apply. The GM sets the DC based on the population of the settlement, the difficulty of finding the easiest-to-find item, how many merchants are in the area, and similar factors. If you choose not to buy the item using a deal right away, the GM determines whether the deal is still good later on. This type of Gather Information action has special outcomes on a success or critical success.


        You can also use the Practice a Trade activity with Diplomacy instead of the Lore skill, spending your days hunting bargains and reselling at a profit.

        When you get a critical success with the Lie action, the target’s attitude toward you improves by one step, as though you’d succeeded at using Diplomacy to Make an Impression. This works only once per conversation, and if you get critical successes against multiple targets using the same result, you choose which creature’s attitude to improve. You must be lying in a way that appears to impart important information­—in other words, your lie must make the target grateful for your supposed help, which trivial or irrelevant lies can’t achieve.

        You have a system that lets you search at great speed, finding details and secrets twice as quickly as others can. When searching, you take half as long as usual to search a given area.

If you’re legendary in Perception, you instead search areas four times as quickly.

        You often smuggle things past the authorities. When the GM rolls your Stealth check to see if a passive observer notices a small item you have concealed, she uses the number rolled or 10, whichever is higher. If you’re a master in Stealth, she uses the number rolled or 15, and if you’re legendary in Stealth, you automatically succeed at hiding a small concealed item from a passive observer. This provides no benefits when a creature attempts a Perception check while actively searching you for hidden items. Due to your skill at smuggling, you are more likely to find more lucrative smuggling tasks when using Underworld Lore to Practice a Trade.

        Tracking is second nature to you, and when necessary you can follow a trail without pause. You can Track while moving at full Speed by taking a –5 penalty to your Survival check. If you’re a master in Survival, you don’t take the –5 penalty. If you’re legendary in Survival, you no longer need to roll a new Survival check every hour when tracking, though you still need to roll whenever there are significant changes in the trail.

        When you use the Perform action, compare your check result to the Will DC of one observer. If you succeed, the target is fascinated with you for 1 round; if the observer is in a situation that demands immediate attention, such as combat, you must critically succeed to fascinate the target. You must choose which creature you’re attempting to fascinate before you roll your check, and regardless of your result, the target is bolstered against your Fascinating Performance. If you’re an expert in Performance, you can compare your check result to the Will DCs of up to four observers and fascinate any number of them. If you’re a master in Performance you can fascinate up to 10 observers with a single check, and if you’re legendary in Performance you can try to fascinate any number of observers at the same time.

        Your body bounces back from extreme situations much more quickly than most. You recover twice as many Hit Points from resting. Each time you succeed at a Fortitude save against an ongoing toxin, you reduce its stage by 2, or by 1 against a virulent toxin. Each critical success you achieve against an ongoing toxin reduces its stage by 3, or by 2 against a virulent toxin. In addition, you reduce the severity of your drained condition by 2 when you rest for a night instead of by 1. You reduce your enervated condition by 2 when you succeed at your Fortitude save or spend a day of downtime training, and by 3 when you critically succeed at your Fortitude save. For more information on these conditions, see page 321.

        While Surviving in the Wilderness during downtime, you can always find enough food and water to provide yourself a subsistence living (provided you aren’t in an area that’s completely lacking in appropriate resources). If you are trained but not better, finding food and water for another or providing a comfortable living still requires you to attempt Survival checks and hope for a critical success; on any other successful result, you still find only enough for your own subsistence.


        If you’re an expert, even without rolling you can always find enough food and water for your own comfortable living or subsistence living for yourself and one other creature that eats roughly as much as a human, and on a critical success you find enough for a second additional creature.


        If you’re a master, you can always find enough for comfortable living for yourself and one other or subsistence living for yourself and two others without rolling, and you can provide for twice as many others on a critical success.


        If you’re legendary, you can always find enough for comfortable living for yourself and four others or subsistence living for yourself and eight others without rolling, but a critical success provides no additional benefit.


        Multiple smaller creatures or creatures with significantly smaller appetites than a human are counted as a single creature for this feat, and larger creatures or those with significantly greater appetite each count as multiple creatures. The GM determines how much a particular non-human creature needs to eat.

        First impressions are your strong suit. When you meet someone, you can immediately attempt a Diplomacy check to Make an Impression with a –5 penalty rather than needing to converse for 1 minute. On a success, you don’t gain any further benefit for spending 1 minute in conversation, but if you fail or critically fail, you can engage in 1 minute of conversation and attempt a new check at the end of that time rather than accepting the failure or critical failure result. This functions only when you meet someone in a social situation, not if you encounter them in a hostile situation such as a combat encounter.

        You are a genius at Crafting, easily able to determine how things are made and create new inventions. You can spend downtime to invent a common formula that you don’t know. This works just like the Craft skill: you spend a number of days in preparation and half the Price of the formula up front, roll a Crafting check, and on a success either finish the formula by paying the difference or work for longer to decrease the Price. The difference is that you spend the additional time in research, design, and development, rather than in creating an item.

        Your ability to steal items defies belief. You can attempt to Steal an Object that is actively wielded or that would be extremely noticeable or time-consuming to remove (like worn shoes or armor). You must do so slowly and carefully, spending at least 1 minute and significantly longer for items that are normally time-consuming to remove (like armor). Throughout this duration you must have some means of staying hidden, whether under cover of darkness or in a bustling crowd, for example. You take a –5 penalty on your Thievery check. Even if you succeed, if the item is extremely prominent, like a suit of full plate armor, onlookers will quickly notice it’s gone after you steal it.

        When you critically succeed using Deception to Create a Diversion, you continue to remain only sensed after the end of your turn. This effect lasts for an amount of time depending on the diversion and the situation, as determined by the GM (but for a minimum of 1 additional round).

        For instance, if Merisiel runs away after throwing a rock in the opposite direction to make noise and achieves a critical success on her Deception check, the guards might continue chasing in the direction of the rock until they either give up pursuit or notice consequences of Merisiel’s later actions.

        Learning new spells comes easily to you. Choose arcane, divine, occult, or primal; you can choose a magic tradition only if you are an expert in the associated skill. You take only 10 minutes per spell level to learn a spell of that type, rather than 1 hour per spell level. If you fail to learn a spell of that type, you can try to learn it again after 1 week or after you gain a level, whichever comes first. If you’re a master in the chosen type of magic’s associated skill, learning a spell takes only 5 minutes per spell level, and if you’re legendary in that skill, it takes only 1 minute per spell level.

        You can spend 10 minutes applying natural cures to heal a creature, after which you must attempt a DC 20 Nature check. On a success, the target regains Hit Points equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom modifier. If you’re a master of Nature, the target regains an additional 1d8 Hit Points. You can use this feat to heal a particular creature only once per day.


        If you’re in the wilderness, you might have easier access to fresh ingredients, allowing you to restore an additional 1d8 Hit Points on a success or critical success, subject to the GM’s determination.

        You can Palm or Steal Objects that are closely guarded, such as an object in a creature’s pocket or a loose ring. You can’t steal objects that are actively wielded or that would be extremely noticeable or time-consuming to remove (like worn shoes or armor). If you’re a master in Thievery, you can attempt to steal from a creature even if it’s in combat or otherwise on guard. When you’re doing so, Stealing an Object requires 2 manipulate actions instead of 1.

        You can attempt to Survive in the Wild on different planes, even those without the resources or natural phenomena you normally need. For instance, you can forage for food even if the plane lacks food that could normally sustain you, and you could find your bearings on a plane that doesn’t have stars, a sun, or other normal aids to navigation. A success at Surviving in the Wild can reduce the plane’s damage as well, at the GM’s discretion.

        The GM rolls a secret Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion check, whichever corresponds to the tradition of the spell being cast. If you’re not trained in the skill, you can’t get a result better than failure. The DC of the check is 10 plus triple the level of the spell. The DC for an uncommon spell is usually 2 higher, and 5 higher for a rare spell.

        You can read the lips of others nearby who you can clearly see. When you’re at your leisure, you can do this automatically. In encounter mode or when attempting a more difficult feat of lip reading, you are fascinated and flat-footed during each round in which you focus on the lip movements, and you must succeed at a Society check (DC determined by the GM) to successfully read someone’s lips in such circumstances.


        If you are deaf or hard of hearing and have Read Lips, you recognize the lip movements for the spoken form of your languages. You can also speak the spoken form of your languages clearly enough for others to understand you, so long as you can produce sound vocally.

Instead of attempting a Crafting check, you attempt a check with the appropriate skill for the spell’s tradition—Arcana for a spell on the arcane spell list, Nature for a primal spell, Occultism for an occult spell, and Religion for a divine spell. If a spell appears on multiple spell lists, you can choose which of the applicable skills to use.


        You must have access to a spell in order to scribe it onto a scroll.

        Your training focused on Crafting one particular kind of item. Select one of the specialties listed below; you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Crafting checks to Craft items of that type. If it’s unclear whether the specialty applies, the GM decides. Some specialties might only partially apply. For example, if you were making a morningstar and had specialty in woodworking, the GM might give you half your bonus because the item requires both blacksmithing and woodworking.

        If you use Palm an Object or Steal an Object on a scroll, spellbook, or similar item, you can remove the magical writing without disturbing the parchment or other surface it was inscribed upon. When you do, you must have a blank scroll or page in your possession that you can transfer the magical writing onto, or else the magic is expended and lost. The GM usually applies a penalty to observers’ Perception checks and DCs to notice the theft, unless the writing is on open display (in the case of an unfurled scroll, for example). You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check because you don’t need to collect the entire object. However, higher-level magic is harder to steal, so the DC is increased by the spell’s level.

        You can keep your balance easily, even when balancing in adverse conditions. You treat a success using the Balance action as a critical success. You’re not flat-footed while attempting to Balance on narrow surfaces and uneven ground, and if you’re the target of an attack or effect that requires a saving throw, you fall only if you critically fail your attempt to Maintain Balance.

In any settlement you frequent regularly, you can use the Recall Knowledge action with Society to know the same sorts of information that you could discover with Diplomacy to Gather Information. The DC is usually significantly higher, but you know the information without spending time gathering it. If you fail to recall the information, you can still subsequently attempt to Gather Information normally.

When you reach level 5 and every time you gain a level thereafter, adjust your maximum Hit Points gained from Toughness accordingly (for example, at level 7, this feat would increase your maximum Hit Points by 7). You also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to recovery saves (see page 295).

        You spend time to teach an animal to act in a particular way, selected from those listed in the Command an Animal action (see page 153). The GM determines the DC of any check required to do so and the amount of time the training takes (usually at least a week). If you’re expert, master, or legendary in Nature, you might be able to train more exotic creatures, at the GM’s discretion.

        You examine a magic item you would normally not be able to use—for example, a fighter normally couldn’t use a scroll, staff, or wand—in an effort to fool the item and activate it temporarily. Attempt a check with a skill DC of the item’s level (typically the low-difficulty DC, but the GM could adjust this at their discretion), using the skill that matches the item’s magic tradition (Arcana for a spell on the arcane spell list, Nature for a primal spell, Occultism for an occult spell, and Religion for a divine spell). You must have identified the magic item (or had it identified for you) in order to activate it this way. If you activate a magic item that requires your spell roll or spell DC and you don’t have the ability to cast spells of the relevant type (such as arcane or divine), you have the untrained proficiency rank and can use the highest of your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma modifiers. If you’re a master in the appropriate skill for that magical tradition, you’re treated as having the trained proficiency rank instead. If the spell’s tradition depends on the caster’s class or requires her to have the spell on her spell list, you choose which class you’re attempting to emulate.

        The actions, activities, free actions, and reactions you can perform with a given skill are sorted into those you can use untrained and those that require you to be at least trained in the skill, as shown on Table 4–1: Skills, Key Abilities, and Uses. The untrained and trained uses of each skill appear in separate sections within the skill’s description.

        Anyone can use a skill’s untrained uses unless some circumstance, condition, or effect bars them from doing so. You can use trained uses only if you’re at least trained in that skill and no circumstance, condition, or effect bars you from that use. Sometimes using a skill in a specific situation might require you to have a higher proficiency rank than what is listed on the table. For instance, even though a high-level barbarian untrained in Arcana could reliably use Arcana to Recall Knowledge regarding the breath weapons of the various colors of dragons, the GM might decide that Recalling Knowledge about the deeper theories behind magical energy of a dragon’s breath weapon might be something beyond the scope of the barbarian’s largely utilitarian and anecdotal knowledge about how to fight dragons. The GM decides whether a task requires a particular proficiency rank, from trained all the way up to legendary.

        As you advance in level, you’ll gain a type of general feat called a skill feat, which often grants you a new use of a skill. Skill feats always have the skill trait. These feats appear in Chapter 5.

        Once you discover that an item, location, or ongoing effect is magical, you can spend an hour to attempt to identify the particulars of its magic. If your attempt is interrupted, you must start over. The GM sets the DC for your check (see Table 4–2 on page 146). Cursed or esoteric subjects usually have higher DCs or might even be impossible to identify using Arcana alone. Heightening a spell doesn’t increase the DC.

        If you are an arcane spellcaster, you can gain
        access to a new arcane spell from someone who knows that spell
        or from magical writing like a spellbook or scroll.


        To learn the spell, you must do the following.
        •	 Spend 1 hour per level of the spell, during which you must
        remain in conversation with the person who knows the spell
        or have the magical writing in your possession.
        •	 Have an amount of magical materials with a value indicated in
        Table 4–2 above.
        •	 Attempt an Arcana check with a DC determined by the GM
        (see Table 4–2 above).

        You can read and understand magic writing as long as it is in a language you can normally read. This usually takes about 1 minute per page of text, but it could take longer in the case of ancient or obscure writings, or in other situations at the GM’s discretion. To read and understand the nuances of particularly archaic, esoteric, or obscure texts, the GM may require you to attempt an Arcana check to see if you understand the true meaning of the magic writing. The GM might have you attempt one check for the entire text or one check for each section of a larger text.

        You can make an item from raw materials. The GM determines the DC to Craft an item, which is based on its level, quality, and rarity, and might be affected by other circumstances. You need the Alchemical Crafting skill feat (page 162) to create alchemical items, the Magical Crafting skill feat (page 168) to create magic items, and the Snare Crafting feat (page 171) to create snares.


        To Craft an item, you must meet the following requirements:
        •	 The item is your level or lower. (An item that doesn’t list a level is level 0.)
        •	 You have the proficiency rank appropriate to the item’s quality. (See page 190.)
        •	 You have the formula for the item.
        •	 You have an appropriate set of tools and, in many cases, a workshop. For example, you need access to a smithy to forge a metal shield.
        •	 You must supply raw materials worth at least half the item’s
        Price. You always expend at least that amount of raw materials when you Craft successfully. If you’re in a settlement, you can usually spend currency to get an equal amount of raw materials you need, except in the case of rarer special materials.


        You need to spend a minimum number of downtime days to Craft your item to a basic state of completion. This number depends on your level and the level of the item. You need to spend 4 downtime days for an item of your level. Reduce the number of days by 1 for each level by which your level exceeds the item’s level, to a minimum of 1 day. After spending this base number of days, you can either expend more materials to complete the item immediately or spend more days Crafting, completing the item more slowly but at lower cost. The success entry explains this mechanic further.


        You can Craft items with the consumable trait in batches, making up to four of the same item simultaneously. This requires you to include the raw materials for all the items in the batch at the start, and you must complete the batch all at once.


        After you expend the required amount of raw materials and base downtime, attempt a Crafting check. If you fail or critically fail, you can try to Craft the item again, but you have to start over.

        Your attempt to create the item is successful. You can pay the remaining half of the item’s Price to complete it immediately, or spend additional downtime days working on it. For each additional day you spend, reduce the value of the materials you need to expend to complete the item by an amount based on your level and proficiency rank (see Table 4–3). After any of these downtime days, you can complete the item by spending the remaining amount. If your downtime days are interrupted, you can return to finish the item later, continuing right where you left off.

        You create a disguise to pass yourself off as someone or something you are not. Putting together a decent disguise takes 10 minutes and requires a disguise kit (see page 184), but a simpler, quicker disguise might do the job if you’re not trying to imitate a specific individual, at the GM’s discretion.


        In most cases, creatures have a chance to detect you only if they use the Seek action to roll Perception checks against your Deception DC. If you attempt to directly interact with someone while disguised, you need to roll a secret Deception check against that creature’s Perception DC instead. If you’re disguised as a specific individual, the GM might give creatures you interact with a bonus based on how well they know the person you’re imitating, or ask you to roll a secret Deception check even if you aren’t directly interacting with them.

        You try to fool someone with an untruth. Doing so takes at least 1 round, or longer if the lie is elaborate. You roll a single Deception check and compare it against the Perception DC of every creature you are trying to fool. The GM may modify this DC based on the situation and the nature of the lie you are trying to tell. Elaborate or highly unbelievable lies are much harder to get a creature to believe than simpler and more believable lies, and some lies are so big it’s impossible to get anyone to believe them.


        At the GM’s discretion, if a creature initially believes your lie, it might still be able to attempt a Perception check against your Deception DC (success on the creature’s part gains the failure effect below) to realize it’s a lie. This usually happens if the creature discovers enough evidence to counter your statements.

        You have specialized information on a narrow topic. Lore is different than other skills in two ways.


        First, the lore skill features many subcategories. You might have Military Lore, Sailing Lore, Vampire Lore, or any similar subcategory of skill. Each subcategory counts as its own skill, so applying a skill increase to Planar Lore wouldn’t increase your modifier with Sailing Lore. You gain a subcategory of the Lore skill from your background. The GM determines what other subcategories she’ll allow as Lore skills, though these categories are always less broad than any of the other skills that allow you to Recall Knowledge, and they should never be able to fully take the place of another skill’s ability to Recall Knowledge. For instance, you couldn’t choose Magic Lore in an attempt to recall the same breadth of knowledge covered by Arcana or Adventuring Lore in an attempt to gain all the information an adventurer would need.


        Second, all of your Lore skills are signature skills (see page 144). This means that you can advance them to expert or legendary proficiency if you so choose.


        If you have multiple subcategories of Lore that could apply to a check, or that would overlap with another skill in the circumstances, you can choose to use the skill with the better skill modifier or that you would prefer to use. If there’s any doubt whether a Lore skill applies to a specific topic or use, the GM decides whether it can be used or not.


        You can perform the following action using any category of Lore, even if you are untrained in any Lore skill or a certain category of Lore.

        You apply the practical benefits of your Lore specialty to earn money during periods of downtime. Practicing a Trade is most effective with Lore specialties such as business, law, or sailing, where there’s demand for workers. The GM might increase the DC if you’re attempting to use an obscure Lore skill to practice a trade.


        The GM assigns a task level representing the difficulty of the most lucrative job available. You can go looking for lower-level tasks, with the GM determining whether you find any. Sometimes you can attempt to find better work than the initial offerings, though this requires spending downtime to Gather Information or researching and socializing.


        When you take on a job, the GM sets the DC of your Lore check. The amount of money you can earn depends on the task level and your proficiency rank, as listed on Table 4–4: Skill Income. You might also need specialized tools to accept a job, like mining tools to work in a mine or a merchant’s scale to buy and sell valuables in a market.


        You need to spend a minimum number of downtime days to locate and secure the job, prepare to practice your trade, and get started on the task. This number depends on your level and the level of the task. You must spend 4 downtime days for a task of your level. Reduce the number of days by 1 for each level lower than you the task is, to a minimum of 1 day. Conversely, increase the number of days by 1 for each level higher than you the task is. After this base downtime, you earn your initial amount of money, and you can continue at the task to keep earning more. The success entry explains how this works. Note that if you want to earn money for working just 1 day, you need to pick a task that requires only 1 day of preparation. A 0-level task always requires 1 day.


        After you spend the base downtime to get started, roll your Lore check to determine your earnings. You continue to earn that amount each day for the duration of the job, without requiring further checks. The GM determines how long the job lasts, which is limited by how long the task will take to complete and other factors. Most tasks last a week or two, though some can take months or even years. If you stop in the middle of a task, normally you have to find a new task when you return, but the GM might decide that you can pick up where you left off (which usually happens only if the job is incomplete and the setup you did is still applicable).

        You issue an order to an animal that’s obeying you, either because you previously used Handle an Animal successfully (see below) or you have the Ride feat (see page 170). Most animals know the Leap, Seek, Stand, Stride, and Strike basic actions. If an animal knows an activity, such as a horse’s Gallop, you can command the animal to perform the activity, but you must spend as many Command an Animal actions as the activity’s number of actions. The animal uses the action you command.


        Most animals understand only the simplest instructions, so you might be able to instruct your animal to move to a certain square but not dictate a specific path to get there, or command it to attack a certain creature but not to make its attack nonlethal. The GM decides the specifics of the action your animal uses.

        You can read and understand occult writing, including complex metaphysical systems, syncretic principles, and incoherent ramblings, as long as it is in a language you can normally read. This usually takes about 1 minute per page of text. To read and understand the nuances of particularly archaic, esoteric, or obscure texts, the GM may require you to attempt an Occultism check to see if you understand the true meaning of the esoterica. The GM might have you attempt one check for the entire text or one check for each section of a larger text.

        When making a brief performance—one song, a quick dance, or a few jokes—you use the Perform action. This action is most useful when you want to prove your capability or impress someone quickly. Performing rarely has an impact on its own (unless you’re in a contest), but doing so might influence the DCs of subsequent Diplomacy checks against the observers if the GM sees fit.

        During downtime, you perform for an audience to make money. The GM determines the levels of the audiences available and gives you a brief description of the most discerning (high-level) audience you could perform for. You can go looking for lower-level audiences, with the GM determining whether you find any. Sometimes you can attempt to find better audiences, though this requires spending downtime to Gather Information or researching and socializing. A typical audience of commoners on the street is a 0-level audience, but a group of artisans with more refined tastes might be a 2nd- or 3rd-level audience, and merchants, nobility, and royalty are increasingly higher level. The level of your audience is the task level for your performance.


        When you choose your audience, the GM secretly sets the DC of your Performance check. The amount of money you can earn depends on the task level and your proficiency rank, as listed on Table 4–4: Skill Income (see page 153).


        You need to spend a minimum number of downtime days to prepare for your performance, get out word to increase demand, allow time for the audience to plan attending, and play your first show. The exact number of days depends on your level and the level of the task. You must spend 4 downtime days for a task of your level. Reduce the number of days by 1 for each level lower than you the task is, to a minimum of 1 day. Conversely, increase the number of days by 1 for each level higher than you the task is. After this base duration, you earn your initial amount of money, and you can continue performing over subsequent days to keep earning more. The success entry explains how this works. Note that if you want to earn money for performing for just 1 day, you need to pick an audience that requires you to spend only 1 day of preparation. Performing for a 0-level audience always requires 1 day.

        After you spend the base downtime to get started, roll your Performance check to determine your earnings. If you do well, the GM might determine you can extend your performance, working more shows to bring in more money; this does not require further checks. Eventually, however, your performance will end because you’ve exhausted your audiences. The GM might let you perform the same show for other audiences, reducing or eliminating the preparation time but lowering the task level.


        Most performances can be staged for a couple weeks, or longer if you perform rarely and do other things with the rest of your downtime. Sometimes, taking time off from performing a show can draw in new high-level audiences, though this usually means you have to spend some time preparing again since you’re rusty.

        •	 Spend 1 hour per level of the spell, during which you must remain in conversation with the person who knows the spell or have the magical writing in your possession.
        •	 Have an amount of magical materials with a value indicated in Table 4–2 on page 146.

        You create a forged document, usually over the course of several hours, a day, or a week. You must have the proper writing material to create a forgery. If the document’s handwriting doesn’t need to be specific to a person, you need only to have seen a similar document before, and you gain up to a +4 circumstance bonus to the check (the GM determines the bonus). To forge a specific person’s handwriting, you need a sample of that person’s handwriting.


        Once someone observes the document, the GM rolls your Society check. If the result exceeds 20, the GM compares it to the observer’s Society DC. If the result is 20 or lower, the observer uses Perception or Society, whichever is higher. An observer who is closely scrutinizing documents on the lookout for a forgery can attempt a Perception or Society check against your Society DC (if they succeed, they know your document is a forgery). Once the GM rolls your check for a document, that same result is used no matter how many creatures observe that document.

If the creature is specifically searching you for an item, they can attempt a Perception check against your Stealth DC (finding the object on success).


        You can also conceal an object somewhere other than your person, such as among undergrowth or in a secret compartment within a piece of furniture. In this case, characters Seeking in an area compare their Perception check results to your Stealth DC to determine whether they find the object.

        You huddle behind cover or deeper into concealment to become merely sensed, rather than seen (see page 302). The GM rolls your Stealth check in secret and compares the result to the Perception DC of each creature that could potentially see you but that you have cover against or are concealed from. If you successfully became sensed to a creature, but then cease to have cover against that creature or be concealed from it, it again sees you. Such creatures see you if you do anything other than Hide or Sneak, though the GM might allow you to perform a particularly unobtrusive action, activity, free action, or reaction without being noticed, possibly requiring another Stealth check.

        You can attempt to move to another place while becoming or staying unseen. Stride up to half your Speed. (You can use Sneak while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type.) The GM rolls your Stealth check in secret and compares the result to the Perception DCs of creatures that you were sensed or unseen by at the start of your movement.


        You automatically become seen if you don’t have cover or aren’t concealed from them at any time during your movement, or as soon as you do anything other than Hide or Sneak. The GM might allow you to perform a particularly unobtrusive action, activity, free action, or reaction without being noticed, possibly requiring another Stealth check. If you speak or make a deliberate loud noise, you become sensed. If you do anything else, you become seen just before you act. For instance, if you attack a creature you’re unseen by, that creature is not flat- footed against that attack.


        If you’re unseen by a creature and it’s impossible for that creature to see you (such as when you’re invisible, the observer is blinded, or you’re in darkness and the creature can’t see in darkness), you automatically treat the result of your d20 roll as a 20 against that creature on your checks to Sneak. You also continue to be unseen if you lose cover against or are no longer concealed from such a creature. Acting to do something other than Hide or Sneak makes you sensed instead of seen. If a creature senses you via Seek, you must Sneak to become unseen by it again.

        Stealing a small (usually of negligible Bulk) object from another person can be very difficult. If the object is worn but relatively unattended (like a loosely carried pouch filled with coins, or an object within such a pouch), the DC to steal the item without detection is equal to the creature’s Perception DC. You can’t steal an object that’s more closely guarded (in a pocket, for example), nor can you steal from a creature who is in combat or otherwise on guard. The GM determines the response of any creature that notices your theft.


        The GM might impose a penalty on your check if the nature of the object makes it harder to steal (such as a very small item in a large pack, or a sheet of parchment mixed in with other documents). The GM can also penalize the Perception DC of observers if they’re distracted.

        Opening a lock without a key is very similar to Disabling a Device, but the DC of the check is determined by the complexity and construction of the lock you are attempting to pick. Unlocking even the simplest of mechanisms almost always requires three or more successful checks to accomplish. If you lack the proper tools, the GM might let you used improvised picks, which are treated as poor-quality tools.
