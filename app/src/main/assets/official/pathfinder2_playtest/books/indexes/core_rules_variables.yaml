        The player character ancestries presented in this book are dwarves, elves, gnomes, goblins, halflings, and humans (including the half-human groups of half- elves and half-orcs). These ancestries are each detailed on the following pages of this chapter.


        Your character also has a background that represents the training or environments she experienced as a youth. This could include time spent working as an acrobat, a barkeep, or a farmhand, or an upbringing like that of a noble, a nomad, or a scholar. Your character’s background affords her extra ability boosts as well as other benefits, such as a feat and training in one Lore skill. The list of character backgrounds begins on page 38 in this chapter.


        A character has one ancestry and one background, both of which you select during character creation. Once chosen, your ancestry and background can’t be changed.

        The dwarves’ ancient surface empire fell long ago, overwhelmed by orc and goblinoid enemies, but dwarves today retain many of the qualities that propelled their people to greatness in ancient times: fierceness, gumption, and stubbornness in endeavors ranging from battle and craftsmanship to forging ties with family and friends. Dwarves are slow to trust people who are not their kin—a tendency that traces to their history of bloody conflict with foes such as giants, orcs, and the horrors of the deeps. Trust from a dwarf is hard won, but as strong as iron.


        These sturdy people stand about a foot shorter than most humans. Long hair is often a source of pride among them, particularly when braided into intricate patterns. Men are typically broader than women, and many men take pride in their long beards. Dwarves typically reach physical adulthood around the age of 25 and can live to around 350 years old.

        The distance between dwarven mountain citadels creates vast cultural divides, but many dwarves share a common passion for architecture, gem cutting, metalwork, mining, and stonework. Dwarves revere honor, justice, and the traditions of their clans and kingdoms. Few dwarves are seen without a clan dagger, a weapon forged just before an individual dwarf’s birth and bearing the gemstone of the clan.

        Your dwarven build allows you to push foes around. Take a Step into the square of a foe that is your size or smaller, and the foe must move into the empty space directly behind it. The foe must move even if doing so places it in harm’s way. The foe can attempt to block your Step by rolling a Fortitude saving throw against your Athletics DC. If the foe attempts this saving throw, regardless of the saving throw’s result, the creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to your level plus your Strength modifier.


        If the foe can’t move into an empty space (if it is surrounded by solid objects or other creatures, for example), your Boulder Roll has no effect.

        Your innate connection to stone makes you adept at moving across uneven surfaces. When you take the Step action, you can ignore difficult terrain caused by uneven ground made of stone and earth. In addition, when you use the Acrobatics skill to Balance (see page 144) on narrow surfaces or uneven ground made of stone or earth, you aren’t flat-footed, and you treat a success on the Acrobatics check as if it were a critical success.

This bonus applies to checks to discover mechanical traps made of stone or hidden inside of stone. If you aren’t using the Seek action (see page 308) or searching, the GM rolls a secret check without the bonus and with a –2 circumstance penalty for you to notice unusual stonework anyway (in such cases, this feat takes on the secret trait).

        Elves combine an otherworldly grace, sharp intellect, and mysterious charm in a way that is practically magnetic to members of other ancestries. They are often voraciously intellectual, though they fill their long years with complicated pedagogies that most shorter-lived peoples find inefficient. Elves also hold notoriously long grudges against their rivals, but these antagonistic relationships can sometimes blossom into friendship over time.


        Elves are generally taller than humans, and they have a fragile grace accentuated with long facial features and sharply pointed ears. Broad pupils fill their wide eyes, giving elves an alien look and allowing them to see sharply even in very little light. Elves typically reach physical adulthood around the age of 20 (though they’re considered by other elves to be fully emotionally mature at close to the end of their first century), and they can live to around 600 years old.


        Elves subtly and deeply attune to their environment and their companions, and they often take on physical traits reflecting their surroundings. An elf who has dwelled in primeval forests for centuries, for example, might exhibit verdant hair and gnarled fingers, while one who’s lived in a desert might have golden pupils and skin.


        Elves are often emotional and capricious, yet they also value kindness and beauty.

        Always hungry for new experiences, gnomes constantly wander both mentally and physically, attempting to stave off a terrible ailment that threatens all of their people. This affliction—the Bleaching—strikes gnomes who fail to dream, innovate, and take in new experiences as their progenitors did every hour of every day in the First World. The Bleaching slowly drains the literal color from gnomes, and it plunges the affected into states of deep depression that eventually claim their lives. Only a very few gnomes survive this scourge, becoming deeply morose and wise survivors known as bleachlings.


        Most gnomes stand just over 3 feet tall and weigh little more than a young human child. Gnomes reach physical adulthood around the age of 18, though many retain a childlike curiosity even into adulthood. Gnomes rarely live longer than 400 years.


        Though they all trace their ancestry to the First World, gnomes otherwise have little culture they point to as their own. Instead, gnomes tend to pick and choose cultural practices of the region in which they live. Gnomes claim no nation in its entirety, and as a people they wouldn’t know what to do with such a state if one existed. Most gnomes consider adventure not a choice but a necessity, and gnome adventurers often collect mementos during their travels that allow them to relive their most exciting stories.

        Even those goblins who break from their destructive past often subtly perpetuate some of the qualities that have been tied to the creatures for millennia. Goblins tend to flock to strong leaders, fiercely protecting those companions who have protected them from physical harm or offered a sympathetic ear when they learn of the goblins’ woes. Some goblins remain deeply fascinated with fire, or fearlessly devour a meal that might turn others’ stomachs. Others are endless tinkerers and view their companions’ trash simply as components of gadgets yet to be made. Occasionally, fellow adventurers find these proclivities unsettling or odd, but more often than not, goblins’ friends consider these qualities endearing.


        Though goblins’ culture has splintered radically, their reputation across the Inner Sea region has changed little. As such, goblins who travel to larger cities are frequently subjected to derision, and as a result many goblins work twice as hard at proving their worth. Those who befriend a goblin quickly learn that while a goblin’s friendship might include all manners of pranks, such fun comes from a place of true acceptance—something that a goblin does not give freely.

        Goblins reach adolescence by the age of 3 and adulthood 4 or 5 years later. In theory, goblins could live 50 years or more, but without anyone to protect them from each other or themselves, few live past 20 years of age. Goblins typically stand about 3 feet tall, with skin colors that range from green to gray to blue.

        Taller folk rarely pay attention to the shadows at Goblin their feet, and you take full advantage of this. You can move 5 feet farther when you take the Sneak action, up to your Speed (see page 158).


        In addition, if you critically succeed at a Stealth check against a creature and then attack that creature, your target remains flat-footed during your attack. The GM doesn’t reveal that your Stealth check resulted in a critical success until you declare your attack.

        Many taller people dismiss halflings due to their size or, worse still, treat them like children. Halflings use these misconceptions and prejudices to their advantage, gaining access to opportunities and performing deeds of daring mischief or heroism. A halfling’s curiosity is tempered with caution, often leading to narrow escapes.

        Despite their jovial and friendly nature, halflings don’t naturally tend to congregate together. They have no cultural homeland, and they instead weave themselves throughout the world’s societies. Halflings usually dwell among humans within the walls of cities, eking out whatever livings they can, many performing menial labor or simple service jobs. Some halflings reject such a life, instead turning to the open road, traveling from place to place in search of fortune and fame. These nomadic halflings often travel in small groups, sharing hardships and simple pleasures among close friends and family.


        Halflings rarely grow to more than 3 feet in height. Tufts of hair warm the tops of their broad, tanned feet, and they prefer to walk barefoot. Halflings typically reach physical adulthood at the age of 20. A typical halfling can live to around 150 years old. Halflings are loyal to their friends and family, but they are not afraid to do what needs to be done in order to survive.


        Halflings’ wanderlust and opportunism make them ideal adventurers, and one popular superstition even claims that traveling with a halfling is good luck.

        Humans’ empires and nations are vast, sprawling things, and their citizens carve names for themselves with the strength of their sword arms and the power of their spells. Humanity is both diverse and tumultuous, running the gamut from cruel to kind, from sinister to saintlike. And while humans build large nation states and free cities alike, many of them venture forth to explore, leaving their homes to map uncharted realms, search for long-lost treasure, or lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors for no better reason than because they can.


        Human variety also manifests in their governments, attitudes, and social norms. Though the oldest of human cultures trace their histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to the societies of the elves or dwarves, human civilizations seem to be in a constant state of flux, as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old.

        Humans typically reach physical adulthood at the age of 18. A typical human can live to be around 90 years old. Humans often intermarry with other peoples, giving rise to children who bear traits of both parents. The most notable half-humans are half-elves and half-orcs. Humans worship a wide range of gods and practice many different religions.

        For many humans, adventuring serves as a means to an end, whether that end is accumulating wealth, striving for acclaim, increasing in social status, or uncovering arcane knowledge and power.

        A half-elf is born to an elf and a human, or to two half- elves. The life of a half-elf can be difficult, marked by a struggle to fit in. Half-elves don’t have their own homeland on Golarion, nor are populations of half-elves particularly tied to one another, since they often have very disparate human and elven heritages. Instead, most half-elves attempt to find acceptance in either human or elven settlements.


        Half-elves often appear primarily human, with subtly pointed ears and a taller stature than most full-blooded humans. Half-elves lack the almost alien eyes of their elf parents, though they do carry a natural presence— and often a striking beauty—that leads many to become artists or entertainers. Despite this innate appeal, many half-elves have difficulty forming lasting bonds with humans or elves due to the disconnection they feel from both peoples as a whole.

        Half-elves live longer than other humans, often reaching an age around 150 years. This causes some of them to fear friendship and romance with humans, knowing that they’ll likely outlive their companions.

          A half-orc is the offspring of a human and an orc, or in some cases, the offspring of two half-orcs. Because some bigoted humans see orcs as more akin to creatures than people, they sometimes hate and fear half-orcs simply due to their lineage. This commonly pushes half-orcs to the margins of society, where some find work in drudgery or as mercenaries, and others tragically fall into crime or cruelty. Many who can’t stand the indignities heaped on them in human society find a home among their orc kin or trek out into the wilderness to live in peace.


          Humans often assume half-orcs are unintelligent or uncivilized, and half-orcs rarely find acceptance among societies with a large concentration of such folk. To an orc tribe, a half-orc is considered intelligent enough to make a good war leader but weaker than the other orcs. Consequently, many half-orcs end up having low status among orc tribes unless they can prove their strength.

          A half-orc has a shorter lifespan than other humans, living to be roughly 70 years old.

        Study of multiple magical traditions reveals how to alter a spell to suit your spellcasting style. Choose one cantrip from a spell list other than your own. If you have a spell repertoire or spellbook, replace one of the cantrips you know or have in your spellbook with the chosen spell. If you prepare spells without a spellbook (if you’re a cleric or druid, for example), one of your cantrips must always be the chosen spell, and you prepare the rest normally.


        If you swap or retrain this cantrip later, you can choose its replacement from the same alternate list or a different one. For more about magic and spells, see page 192.

If a creature fails to Coerce you using the Intimidation skill (see page 150), it treats the result as a critical failure instead (so it can’t try to Coerce you again for 1 week).

        Your character’s ancestry section states which languages she speaks at 1st level. Having an Intelligence score of 14 or higher also grants one additional language, which you can choose from the list presented in your character’s ancestry entry and from those available from your region or ethnicity.

        The languages presented in this section are grouped according to how commonly they are found throughout the Inner Sea region. Languages that are common are regularly found in most places, even among those who aren’t native speakers. Languages that are uncommon are most frequently spoken by native speakers, but they are also spoken by certain scholars and others interested in those associated cultures.

        Pathfinder also includes Druidic, which is a secret language. Druidic is not available to characters who are not druids, and druids are prohibited from teaching the language to nondruids, as described further on page 81.


        It is, of course, possible for your character to learn languages later in her adventuring career. The Multilingual feat (see page 169), for example, grants two new languages that can be chosen from the languages listed in the common and uncommon tables below. Other abilities and effects might grant access to common or uncommon languages as detailed in their descriptions.

        Your character might use sign language instead of spoken language. This is especially common for a character who is deaf or hard of hearing or who can’t speak. In this case, your character can communicate using the sign languages associated with the languages she selects, as well as being able to read and write the written forms of those languages.


        When you first choose your character’s languages, you must decide whether she knows the sign language versions of all of her languages or their spoken versions. If you choose sign language instead of spoken language, your character receives Read Lips (see page 170) as a bonus feat. However, if your character is unable to speak, that feat may not convey the ability to speak. A deaf or hard of hearing character can’t use hearing as an imprecise sense (see page 301). Should your character lose or gain her sense of hearing during the game, she can spend downtime retraining her languages from spoken to signed or vice versa. If you’re playing a hearing character who would know one or more sign languages as a result of her backstory (for example, a hearing character with a deaf parent), you may get Sign Language (see page 171) as a bonus feat at the GM’s discretion.


        Sign languages typically require both hands to convey more than basic concepts, and they require direct visual attention to understand. Since they are quiet, they are ideal for infiltrations in exploration mode, but the required attention makes them extremely difficult to understand in combat. Much as a character can’t engage in complex spoken dialogue while swinging a sword, a character can’t communicate a hefty amount of information in sign language during combat, but simple concepts such as designating a target, mocking a foe, or signaling an ally to look out can be conveyed through signs as easily as shouted words. Using sign language in some situations, such as areas of low visibility, can be tricky—just as it can be difficult to communicate verbally in a noisy environment.

        Learning a new language affords your character opportunities, particularly if you choose a language to fit the adventure, such as learning Undercommon before an adventure in the Darklands. While in most cases you can eventually find an NPC who also speaks Common, knowing the language yourself allows you to hear what the NPCs are saying to each other and appeal to NPCs other than your translator. Your whole party could even learn a little-known language that you use for secret communications!

        Just as your character’s ancestry plays a key role in expressing her identity and worldview, her class indicates the training she has developed and will improve upon as an adventurer. Groups of players often wish to create characters whose skills and abilities synergize mechanically, and in this respect, choosing your character’s class is perhaps the most important decision you will make for her.

        Although there are a limited number of character classes from which you can choose, there are unlimited character concepts that these rules allow you to bring to life. Perhaps your character is a brilliant but scatterbrained alchemist who can rattle off complex formulas for alchemical items but has trouble remembering his best friend’s birthday. Or perhaps she’s a muscle-bound swordswoman who becomes as immovable as a mountain when she hoists a shield. Maybe your character is a hot-tempered sorcerer whose gesticulating fingers pulse with light from an angelic ancestor. The choices you make for your character within her class—such as a cleric’s choice of god, a fighter’s choice of weapon, or a sorcerer’s bloodline— bring these visions to life within the context of the rules.


        The following entries describe Pathfinder’s 12 core classes, containing the information you need to play a character of that class from level 1 to 20. Once you choose your character’s class, the game’s rules provide optional archetypes that allow you to further customize her abilities, though these rules (described on page 279) are not recommended for beginners. Additionally, the game includes multiclass archetypes that allow her to gain abilities from other classes.

        Each class entry includes information about typical members of the class, as well as suggestions for roleplaying characters of that class and playing such characters in the game’s various modes. Each class provides your character with an ability boost in a key ability score, a number of Hit Points she receives at each level, her proficiencies in various abilities and equipment, signature skills in which she can excel, special abilities from her class features, and more. Your character’s class entry also provides all of the information needed when she gains levels, so it will be a vital reference to you throughout the course of your campaign.

        This is the ability score that you’ll use to determine the Difficulty Class (DC) associated with your character’s class features or feats. This is called your class DC. If your character is of a spellcasting class, this key ability is also used to calculate spell DCs and similar values. Most classes are associated with one key ability score, but some require you to choose from two options.


        Additionally, when you choose your character’s class, she gains an ability boost in her key ability. For more about ability boosts, see page 43.

        Each time your character gains a level, she receives an additional number of Hit Points equal to this number plus her Constitution modifier. For more about calculating your character’s Constitution modifier and determining her Hit Points, see page 14.

        This lists the degree to which your character is trained in key aspects of the game’s mechanics. This training is called her proficiency rank, and your character’s proficiency rank in a mechanic determines her modifier when she makes a roll using that mechanic. Proficiency ranks range from untrained to legendary, and the associated modifiers range from your character’s level minus 2 to her level plus 3. For more about proficiency ranks, see page 8.


        Each class entry typically specifies your character’s proficiency rank in Perception, saving throws, weapons, and armor. If a mechanic isn’t listed in your character’s class entry, her proficiency rank in that mechanic is considered untrained unless she gains training from another source.


        Additionally, this section indicates the number of skills in which your character is trained. When you choose your character’s class, you also select a number of skills equal to this number; your character gains the trained proficiency rank in those skills. If your character has a high Intelligence score, she’s trained in a higher number of skills.


        Spellcasting classes provide proficiency in spells, which is further detailed in each class’s entry.

        You gain the Alchemical Crafting feat (see page 162), even if you don’t meet that feat’s prerequisites, and you gain the four additional common 1st-level alchemical formulas that feat grants. The list of alchemical items begins on page 360. You can use this feat to create common alchemical items as long as you have their formulas in your formula book, though their power is fleeting. You can create these items in two different ways, as described below. An alchemical item you create this way has the infused trait. First, during your daily preparations (described on page 332), you can create items for which you have the formulas. Creating items in this way requires spending 1 Resonance Point to create a batch of alchemical items of that type with the infused trait. You select how many items are in the batch, up to half the normal maximum batch size (half a typical batch is two items, but see the Crafting Trained Activities section on page for more information). You don’t need to attempt a Crafting check to do this, and you ignore the number of days typically required to create the items and any requirements of alchemical reagents. You can’t overspend Resonance Points to create infused items in this way during your daily preparations.


        Second, you can create alchemical items with the Quick Alchemy action, described below.

        Each time you gain a new level, you can add formulas for two alchemical items to your formula book. These can be of any level of item you can create.

When you throw an alchemical item of 3rd level or higher with the bomb and splash traits, you can choose for the bomb’s splash damage to deal extra damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 0) instead of the normal amount.

        Because of the great amount of time you’ve spent studying and experimenting, you know how to scale up your formulas to larger batches without giving them any additional attention. When spending downtime to Craft alchemical items, you can produce twice the number of alchemical items in a single batch without needing to spend additional preparatory time. For instance, if you are crafting elixirs of life, you can craft up to four elixirs in a single batch using downtime, rather than two. This does not reduce the amount of required alchemical reagents or other ingredients needed to craft each item, nor does it increase your rate of progress for days past the base downtime spent. This also does not change the number of items you can create in a batch with advanced alchemy.

        When using Quick Alchemy to craft an alchemical item with the bomb trait, you can build it to explode automatically after a certain amount of time. This delay can be any number of rounds up to your level, chosen when you craft the bomb. When this delayed bomb explodes, it deals damage to a creature within its square as if that creature had been hit by an attack with the bomb (if there are multiple creatures in the square, choose the target randomly). It also deals its splash damage (if any) as if you had thrown the bomb at the target.

        Unlike other items crafted with the Quick Alchemy action, the delayed bomb remains potent until it explodes or you defuse it. You can use the Interact action with a delayed bomb you made in order to defuse it. Other creatures can try to Disable a Device to defuse the bomb, using your class DC for the Thievery check.

If you use the specific antidote on yourself and you have the formula for the poison or venom affecting you, increase the counteract level of the specific antidote by 1.

For example, you can combine two of the same elixirs to create a combined elixir of life that heals double the amount. If a creature other than you drinks a combined elixir, it must spend 2 Resonance Points to gain the effects instead of only 1 Resonance Point.

On a success, the poison is applied to the target. On a failure, the poison is wasted.

Whenever you use any alchemical item with the bomb trait, it responds to you as if it were infused and you were the one who created it. Whenever you use any mutagen, you also treat it as if it were infused and attuned to you.

        Rage consumes you in battle. You delight in carving through your enemies using powerful weapons and wreaking havoc, relying on astonishing durability, without needing complicated techniques or rigid training. You associate your rage with a traditional symbol of affinity known as a totem, which might take the form of an animal, a spirit, or a part of yourself. To many barbarians, brute force is a hammer and every problem looks like a nail, whereas others try to hold back the dark emotions inside them and release them only when it matters most.

        As a barbarian, you channel the power of your rage through a totem. Traditionally, this is a spiritual or tribal symbol, but you choose what your totem means to you; it might describe a purely internal source or filter of your rage, such as a belief, curse, exotic heritage, or state of mind. Each totem grants you a totem ability, plus more abilities you can gain via totem feats, and it determines what types of damage you resist with the raging resistance class feature.


        Each totem lists acts that are anathema to it. Whenever you perform such acts, you lose the totem’s power and any totem feats until you spend 1 day of downtime recentering yourself, though you keep all other barbarian abilities.

        You breathe in deeply and then exhale powerful energy in either a 30-foot cone or a 60-foot line, dealing 1d6 damage per barbarian level. Each creature in the area must attempt a Reflex save.

        Your breath’s area (line or cone) and damage type match your chosen dragon. This ability counts as a spell of half your level rounded up.

        When you Rage, you transform into a Medium form of your totem animal, gaining the animal trait in addition to your normal traits. All your gear is absorbed into your form; all constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can’t activate any item abilities. When you transform, you gain the following:

        • Ignore your armor’s check penalty and Speed reduction.

        • You gain the same number of temporary Hit Points that you normally gain when you are raging
        • You gain low-light vision

        Your animal form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and taking most actions with the manipulate trait that require your hands. (The GM determines which manipulate actions you can use if there’s doubt.) You can dismiss this effect by spending an action (this action has the rage and concentrate traits).

        While in animal form, you gain the attacks, movement types, and special abilities listed for your chosen animal, and you retain the attack or attacks from bestial rage (see Table 3–3: Animal Totems on page 55). You choose the specific type of animal you turn into within the broader category (such as a lion or snow leopard for cat). This has no effect on your animal form’s size or statistics.

Even if you’re Leaping vertically, you determine the DC for the height you’re jumping using the DC of a Long Jump.


        After your Strike, you fall to the ground if you’re in the air. If the distance of your fall is no more than the height of your jump, you take no damage and land upright.

        When you use Spell Sunder, you can instead attempt to counteract either an unattended magic item or one of your target’s magic items. If your counteract attempt succeeds, the item becomes a mundane item of its type for 10 minutes. This doesn’t change the item’s quality. As with Spell Sunder, the target is bolstered whether or not you succeed. If you target an artifact or other particularly powerful item, then your counteract attempt automatically fails.

        You transform into a Large form of a dragon that matches the dragon type of your dragon totem until you stop raging, gaining the dragon trait in addition to your normal traits while in this form. You must have enough space to expand into, or your transformation fails. All your gear is absorbed into your form; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can’t activate any item abilities. When you transform, you gain the following.

        • Ignore your armor’s check penalty and Speed reduction, if any.
        • One or more melee unarmed Strikes depending on your dragon form (see page 218), which are the only type of attacks you can use. You’re trained with them. When attacking with them, your damage bonus is +6. These are Strength-based attacks (for the purposes of the enfeebled condition, for example).
        • Temporary Hit Points equal to the amount you gain when you are raging.
        • Resistance 10 against the damage type of your breath weapon.
        • Blindsense 60 feet, darkvision.
        • Speed 40 feet and fly Speed 100 feet.
        • A breath weapon you can activate by spending 2 actions. A creature that succeeds at a DC 24 saving throw takes half damage, no damage on a critical success, and double damage on a critical failure. The saving throw is a Reflex save unless stated otherwise in the special ability description. Once you activate your breath weapon, you can’t use it again for 1d4 rounds. Your breath weapon is an arcane evocation effect with the appropriate damage trait. The shape, damage, damage type, and saving throw type depend on your dragon form (see page 218). After you use your breath weapon, you still have to wait the full delay even if your transformation ends and you transform anew.

        The special statistics of your dragon form can be adjusted only by penalties, circumstance bonuses, and conditional bonuses (such as those you gain while raging). Your dragon form prevents you from casting spells or taking most actions with the manipulate trait that require your hands. (The GM determines which actions you can use if there’s any doubt.) You can dismiss this effect by spending an action (this action has the rage and concentrate traits).


        You gain the benefits for your chosen dragon’s type listed in the dragon form spell (see page 218).


        At 18th level, your fly Speed is accelerated 20, your damage bonus increases to +12, your breath weapon DC increases to 30, and you gain a +14 conditional bonus to breath weapon damage.

        You shake the ground, topple creatures, and shatter structures in a 60-foot aura around you.


        • All squares in the area become difficult terrain. Attack rolls and skill checks by creatures on the ground take a –2 circumstance penalty.
        • Any creature on the ground within the area must attempt a Reflex save at the start of its turn to keep its footing and avoid falling into fissures that open up in the ground. The fissures are 40 feet deep, so anyone who falls in takes 20 bludgeoning damage. The fissures are permanent, and their walls require a DC 15 Athletics check to Climb. You automatically succeed at your saving throw to avoid any fissures you create.
        • Any structure or ceiling in the area has a chance to collapse. The GM makes a flat check for each structure, determining the DC for each (DC 16 for a sturdy structure, DC 14 for an average structure and most natural formations, DC 9 for a shoddy structure, or higher or lower as the GM sees fit). A collapse deals 11d6 bludgeoning damage; any creature caught in a collapse must attempt a Reflex save to escape it. Success Target takes half collapse damage and fall


        Your Quaking Stomp might have additional effects in certain types of terrain. For instance, a cliff might collapse, causing creatures atop it to fall, or a lake might drain as the fissures open up below its surface and leave a morass of quicksand. The GM determines these additional effects.

        You have the power to cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you gain access to the Material Casting, Somatic Casting, and Verbal Casting actions (see Casting Spells on page 195). Because you’re a bard, you can usually play an instrument as part of your Material Casting and Somatic Casting actions, so you usually don’t need spell components or another hand free. You can usually also play an instrument for your Verbal Casting actions rather than speaking.


        Each day, you can cast up to two 1st-level spells. The number of spells you can cast each day are called your spell slots. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. As you increase in level as a bard, your number of spells per day and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increases, as shown on the Bard Spells per Day table on page 65.


        Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC. Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier. See page 291 for details on calculating your spell rolls and spell DCs.

        Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn’t use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to the highest level of spell you can cast as a bard. For example, as a 1st- level bard, the highest level of spell you can cast is 1st, so your cantrips are 1st-level spells. As a 5th-level bard, the highest level of spell you can cast is 3rd, so your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.

        At 1st level, you learn one 1st-level occult spell of your choice and four occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells on the occult spell list in this book (see page 200) or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level.


        You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot from Table 3–6, you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. So when you reach 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select two 2nd-level spells, and at 4th level you select a 2nd-level spell.


        Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn’t give you another spell slot, and vice versa.

        Compositions are a special type of spell that require you to use the Performance skill as a part of their casting. At 1st level, bards gain two types of composition spells: composition cantrips and composition powers (which both have the composition trait). You gain the inspire courage composition cantrip (see page 233), which boosts your allies’ attacks, damage, and defense against fear. This is in addition to the cantrips you choose from the occult list. Feats can give you more composition cantrips. Unlike other cantrips, you can’t swap out compositions gained from bard feats at a later level, unless you swap out the specific feat via retraining (see page 318).


        You can also cast a composition power called counter performance (see page 212) that protects against auditory and visual effects. You have a pool of Spell Points you can spend to cast this spell. Your maximum number of Spell Points is equal to your key ability modifier (minimum 0). You regain all your Spell Points during your daily preparations. You can cast counter performance only by spending 1 Spell Point, not using spell slots. This power is automatically heightened to the highest level of spell you can cast.


        Some bard feats let you learn more composition powers, and such feats typically increase your pool of Spell Points.

        Lore: Your muse drives you to uncover the hidden secrets of the multiverse. You gain the Bardic Lore feat and add true strike to your spell repertoire.


        Maestro: Your muse inspires you to ever-greater heights of performance. You gain the Lingering Composition feat and add soothe to your spell repertoire.

        During your daily preparations, choose any one spell from your spellbook. If the spell you choose is already in your spell repertoire, you can heighten it with spontaneous heightening that day. If it isn’t in your repertoire, treat it as though it were in it for that day.

        You have the power to cast divine spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you gain access to the Material Casting, Somatic Casting, and Verbal Casting actions (see Spellcasting on page 195). Because you’re a cleric, you can usually hold a divine focus (such as a religious symbol or a religious text) as part of your Material Casting and Somatic Casting actions, so you usually don’t need spell components or another hand free. At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-level spells and four cantrips each morning from the common spells on the divine spell list in this book (see page 200) or from other divine spells to which you gain access. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare are called your spell slots.


        As you increase in level as a cleric, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest level of spell you can cast, as shown on the Cleric Spells per Day table on page 70.

        Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC. Since your key ability is Wisdom, your spell rolls and spell DCs use your Wisdom modifier. See page 291 for details on calculating your spell rolls and spell DCs.

        When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can prepare lower-level spells in those slots to strengthen them. This increases the spell’s level to match the heightened spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels (see page 192).

        A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn’t use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to the highest level of spell you can cast as a cleric. For example, as a 1st-level cleric, the highest level of spell you can cast is 1st, so your cantrips are 1st-level spells. As a 5th-level cleric, the highest level of spell you can cast is 3rd, so your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.

        Choose one deity you revere above all others. The most common deities in Pathfinder appear on Table 3–9: Deities on pages 72–73. This table lists each deity’s name, areas of concern, and alignment, followed by the benefits you get for being a cleric of that deity. Your alignment must be one allowed by your deity, as listed in parentheses after the deity’s alignment. Your deity grants you a signature skill and the trained proficiency rank with the deity’s favored weapon. If the favored weapon is uncommon, you also get access to that weapon. Your deity also adds spells to your spell list. When preparing spells, you can select from these in addition to the spells on the divine list once you can cast that level of spell.


        Select one domain—a subject of particular interest to you within the traditions of your religion—from your deity’s list of domains. This domain grants you a special kind of spell called a domain power. Each domain’s theme and powers appear in Table 3–10: Domains on page 73. By choosing a domain, you gain a pool of Spell Points you can spend to cast domain powers. You can cast domain powers only by spending Spell Points, not by using spell slots. Your maximum number of Spell Points equals your key ability modifier (minimum 0). You regain all your Spell Points when you prepare your spells. You gain the initial power tied to your domain when you select the domain. Your initial domain power costs 1 Spell Point to cast and is automatically heightened to the highest level of spell you can cast. Domain powers are available only to characters who’ve selected the domain and can’t be learned by others.


        Some cleric feats grant you more domain powers, and such feats typically increase your pool of Spell Points. You can learn additional powers, called advanced domain powers, by taking the Advanced Domain cleric feat. The Spell Point cost of this advanced domain power is listed in parentheses after its name in Table 3–10: Domains.

        Actions fundamentally opposed to your deity’s alignment or ideals are anathema to your faith. Committing acts, learning or casting spells, and using items that are anathema to your deity take you out of that deity’s good graces.


        Casting spells with the evil trait is almost always anathema to good deities, and casting good spells is likewise anathema to evil deities; similarly, casting chaotic spells is anathema to lawful deities and casting lawful spells is anathema to chaotic deities. A neutral cleric who worships a neutral deity isn’t limited this way, but their alignment might change over time if they frequently cast spells or use abilities with a certain alignment. Similarly, casting spells that are anathema to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your connection to your deity. For example, casting a spell to enhance your ability to lie would be anathema to Sarenrae, as a goddess of honesty, and casting one to create undead would be anathema to Pharasma, the goddess of death.


        For borderline cases, you and your GM determine whether other acts count as anathema. For example, Torag is a god of community, so actions that work to destroy a close-knit community are typically anathema to Torag. However, as god of dwarves, he might permit you to destroy a community of giants that is threatening to wipe out a dwarven settlement.


        If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity or if your alignment changes to one not allowed by your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include channel energy, domain powers, and divine spellcasting. These abilities can be regained only if you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an atone ritual (see page 275).

        You gain a pool of positive or negative energy, depending on your deity, as shown on Table 3–9: Deities on pages 72–73. Some deities allow you to choose whether to channel negative or positive energy. Once you choose, you can’t change the type of energy you channel, short of an ethical shift or divine intervention.


        This pool of energy allows you to cast either the heal spell (for positive energy) or the harm spell (for negative energy) a number of times per day equal to 3 plus your Charisma modifier without needing to prepare the spell in advance. All spells you cast in this way are heightened to the maximum spell level you can cast as a cleric. You can find heal on page 229 and harm on page 228.
