        The player character ancestries presented in this book are dwarves, elves, gnomes, goblins, halflings, and humans (including the half-human groups of half- elves and half-orcs). These ancestries are each detailed on the following pages of this chapter.


        Your character also has a background that represents the training or environments she experienced as a youth. This could include time spent working as an acrobat, a barkeep, or a farmhand, or an upbringing like that of a noble, a nomad, or a scholar. Your character’s background affords her extra ability boosts as well as other benefits, such as a feat and training in one Lore skill. The list of character backgrounds begins on page 38 in this chapter.


        A character has one ancestry and one background, both of which you select during character creation. Once chosen, your ancestry and background can’t be changed.

        The dwarves’ ancient surface empire fell long ago, overwhelmed by orc and goblinoid enemies, but dwarves today retain many of the qualities that propelled their people to greatness in ancient times: fierceness, gumption, and stubbornness in endeavors ranging from battle and craftsmanship to forging ties with family and friends. Dwarves are slow to trust people who are not their kin—a tendency that traces to their history of bloody conflict with foes such as giants, orcs, and the horrors of the deeps. Trust from a dwarf is hard won, but as strong as iron.


        These sturdy people stand about a foot shorter than most humans. Long hair is often a source of pride among them, particularly when braided into intricate patterns. Men are typically broader than women, and many men take pride in their long beards. Dwarves typically reach physical adulthood around the age of 25 and can live to around 350 years old.

        The distance between dwarven mountain citadels creates vast cultural divides, but many dwarves share a common passion for architecture, gem cutting, metalwork, mining, and stonework. Dwarves revere honor, justice, and the traditions of their clans and kingdoms. Few dwarves are seen without a clan dagger, a weapon forged just before an individual dwarf’s birth and bearing the gemstone of the clan.

        Your dwarven build allows you to push foes around. Take a Step into the square of a foe that is your size or smaller, and the foe must move into the empty space directly behind it. The foe must move even if doing so places it in harm’s way. The foe can attempt to block your Step by rolling a Fortitude saving throw against your Athletics DC. If the foe attempts this saving throw, regardless of the saving throw’s result, the creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to your level plus your Strength modifier.


        If the foe can’t move into an empty space (if it is surrounded by solid objects or other creatures, for example), your Boulder Roll has no effect.

        Your innate connection to stone makes you adept at moving across uneven surfaces. When you take the Step action, you can ignore difficult terrain caused by uneven ground made of stone and earth. In addition, when you use the Acrobatics skill to Balance (see page 144) on narrow surfaces or uneven ground made of stone or earth, you aren’t flat-footed, and you treat a success on the Acrobatics check as if it were a critical success.

This bonus applies to checks to discover mechanical traps made of stone or hidden inside of stone. If you aren’t using the Seek action (see page 308) or searching, the GM rolls a secret check without the bonus and with a –2 circumstance penalty for you to notice unusual stonework anyway (in such cases, this feat takes on the secret trait).

        Elves combine an otherworldly grace, sharp intellect, and mysterious charm in a way that is practically magnetic to members of other ancestries. They are often voraciously intellectual, though they fill their long years with complicated pedagogies that most shorter-lived peoples find inefficient. Elves also hold notoriously long grudges against their rivals, but these antagonistic relationships can sometimes blossom into friendship over time.


        Elves are generally taller than humans, and they have a fragile grace accentuated with long facial features and sharply pointed ears. Broad pupils fill their wide eyes, giving elves an alien look and allowing them to see sharply even in very little light. Elves typically reach physical adulthood around the age of 20 (though they’re considered by other elves to be fully emotionally mature at close to the end of their first century), and they can live to around 600 years old.


        Elves subtly and deeply attune to their environment and their companions, and they often take on physical traits reflecting their surroundings. An elf who has dwelled in primeval forests for centuries, for example, might exhibit verdant hair and gnarled fingers, while one who’s lived in a desert might have golden pupils and skin.


        Elves are often emotional and capricious, yet they also value kindness and beauty.

        Always hungry for new experiences, gnomes constantly wander both mentally and physically, attempting to stave off a terrible ailment that threatens all of their people. This affliction—the Bleaching—strikes gnomes who fail to dream, innovate, and take in new experiences as their progenitors did every hour of every day in the First World. The Bleaching slowly drains the literal color from gnomes, and it plunges the affected into states of deep depression that eventually claim their lives. Only a very few gnomes survive this scourge, becoming deeply morose and wise survivors known as bleachlings.


        Most gnomes stand just over 3 feet tall and weigh little more than a young human child. Gnomes reach physical adulthood around the age of 18, though many retain a childlike curiosity even into adulthood. Gnomes rarely live longer than 400 years.


        Though they all trace their ancestry to the First World, gnomes otherwise have little culture they point to as their own. Instead, gnomes tend to pick and choose cultural practices of the region in which they live. Gnomes claim no nation in its entirety, and as a people they wouldn’t know what to do with such a state if one existed. Most gnomes consider adventure not a choice but a necessity, and gnome adventurers often collect mementos during their travels that allow them to relive their most exciting stories.

        Even those goblins who break from their destructive past often subtly perpetuate some of the qualities that have been tied to the creatures for millennia. Goblins tend to flock to strong leaders, fiercely protecting those companions who have protected them from physical harm or offered a sympathetic ear when they learn of the goblins’ woes. Some goblins remain deeply fascinated with fire, or fearlessly devour a meal that might turn others’ stomachs. Others are endless tinkerers and view their companions’ trash simply as components of gadgets yet to be made. Occasionally, fellow adventurers find these proclivities unsettling or odd, but more often than not, goblins’ friends consider these qualities endearing.


        Though goblins’ culture has splintered radically, their reputation across the Inner Sea region has changed little. As such, goblins who travel to larger cities are frequently subjected to derision, and as a result many goblins work twice as hard at proving their worth. Those who befriend a goblin quickly learn that while a goblin’s friendship might include all manners of pranks, such fun comes from a place of true acceptance—something that a goblin does not give freely.

        Goblins reach adolescence by the age of 3 and adulthood 4 or 5 years later. In theory, goblins could live 50 years or more, but without anyone to protect them from each other or themselves, few live past 20 years of age. Goblins typically stand about 3 feet tall, with skin colors that range from green to gray to blue.

        Taller folk rarely pay attention to the shadows at Goblin their feet, and you take full advantage of this. You can move 5 feet farther when you take the Sneak action, up to your Speed (see page 158).


        In addition, if you critically succeed at a Stealth check against a creature and then attack that creature, your target remains flat-footed during your attack. The GM doesn’t reveal that your Stealth check resulted in a critical success until you declare your attack.

        Many taller people dismiss halflings due to their size or, worse still, treat them like children. Halflings use these misconceptions and prejudices to their advantage, gaining access to opportunities and performing deeds of daring mischief or heroism. A halfling’s curiosity is tempered with caution, often leading to narrow escapes.

        Despite their jovial and friendly nature, halflings don’t naturally tend to congregate together. They have no cultural homeland, and they instead weave themselves throughout the world’s societies. Halflings usually dwell among humans within the walls of cities, eking out whatever livings they can, many performing menial labor or simple service jobs. Some halflings reject such a life, instead turning to the open road, traveling from place to place in search of fortune and fame. These nomadic halflings often travel in small groups, sharing hardships and simple pleasures among close friends and family.


        Halflings rarely grow to more than 3 feet in height. Tufts of hair warm the tops of their broad, tanned feet, and they prefer to walk barefoot. Halflings typically reach physical adulthood at the age of 20. A typical halfling can live to around 150 years old. Halflings are loyal to their friends and family, but they are not afraid to do what needs to be done in order to survive.


        Halflings’ wanderlust and opportunism make them ideal adventurers, and one popular superstition even claims that traveling with a halfling is good luck.

        Humans’ empires and nations are vast, sprawling things, and their citizens carve names for themselves with the strength of their sword arms and the power of their spells. Humanity is both diverse and tumultuous, running the gamut from cruel to kind, from sinister to saintlike. And while humans build large nation states and free cities alike, many of them venture forth to explore, leaving their homes to map uncharted realms, search for long-lost treasure, or lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors for no better reason than because they can.


        Human variety also manifests in their governments, attitudes, and social norms. Though the oldest of human cultures trace their histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to the societies of the elves or dwarves, human civilizations seem to be in a constant state of flux, as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old.

        Humans typically reach physical adulthood at the age of 18. A typical human can live to be around 90 years old. Humans often intermarry with other peoples, giving rise to children who bear traits of both parents. The most notable half-humans are half-elves and half-orcs. Humans worship a wide range of gods and practice many different religions.

        For many humans, adventuring serves as a means to an end, whether that end is accumulating wealth, striving for acclaim, increasing in social status, or uncovering arcane knowledge and power.

        A half-elf is born to an elf and a human, or to two half- elves. The life of a half-elf can be difficult, marked by a struggle to fit in. Half-elves don’t have their own homeland on Golarion, nor are populations of half-elves particularly tied to one another, since they often have very disparate human and elven heritages. Instead, most half-elves attempt to find acceptance in either human or elven settlements.


        Half-elves often appear primarily human, with subtly pointed ears and a taller stature than most full-blooded humans. Half-elves lack the almost alien eyes of their elf parents, though they do carry a natural presence— and often a striking beauty—that leads many to become artists or entertainers. Despite this innate appeal, many half-elves have difficulty forming lasting bonds with humans or elves due to the disconnection they feel from both peoples as a whole.

        Half-elves live longer than other humans, often reaching an age around 150 years. This causes some of them to fear friendship and romance with humans, knowing that they’ll likely outlive their companions.

          A half-orc is the offspring of a human and an orc, or in some cases, the offspring of two half-orcs. Because some bigoted humans see orcs as more akin to creatures than people, they sometimes hate and fear half-orcs simply due to their lineage. This commonly pushes half-orcs to the margins of society, where some find work in drudgery or as mercenaries, and others tragically fall into crime or cruelty. Many who can’t stand the indignities heaped on them in human society find a home among their orc kin or trek out into the wilderness to live in peace.


          Humans often assume half-orcs are unintelligent or uncivilized, and half-orcs rarely find acceptance among societies with a large concentration of such folk. To an orc tribe, a half-orc is considered intelligent enough to make a good war leader but weaker than the other orcs. Consequently, many half-orcs end up having low status among orc tribes unless they can prove their strength.

          A half-orc has a shorter lifespan than other humans, living to be roughly 70 years old.

        Study of multiple magical traditions reveals how to alter a spell to suit your spellcasting style. Choose one cantrip from a spell list other than your own. If you have a spell repertoire or spellbook, replace one of the cantrips you know or have in your spellbook with the chosen spell. If you prepare spells without a spellbook (if you’re a cleric or druid, for example), one of your cantrips must always be the chosen spell, and you prepare the rest normally.


        If you swap or retrain this cantrip later, you can choose its replacement from the same alternate list or a different one. For more about magic and spells, see page 192.

If a creature fails to Coerce you using the Intimidation skill (see page 150), it treats the result as a critical failure instead (so it can’t try to Coerce you again for 1 week).

        Your character’s ancestry section states which languages she speaks at 1st level. Having an Intelligence score of 14 or higher also grants one additional language, which you can choose from the list presented in your character’s ancestry entry and from those available from your region or ethnicity.

        The languages presented in this section are grouped according to how commonly they are found throughout the Inner Sea region. Languages that are common are regularly found in most places, even among those who aren’t native speakers. Languages that are uncommon are most frequently spoken by native speakers, but they are also spoken by certain scholars and others interested in those associated cultures.

        Pathfinder also includes Druidic, which is a secret language. Druidic is not available to characters who are not druids, and druids are prohibited from teaching the language to nondruids, as described further on page 81.


        It is, of course, possible for your character to learn languages later in her adventuring career. The Multilingual feat (see page 169), for example, grants two new languages that can be chosen from the languages listed in the common and uncommon tables below. Other abilities and effects might grant access to common or uncommon languages as detailed in their descriptions.

        Your character might use sign language instead of spoken language. This is especially common for a character who is deaf or hard of hearing or who can’t speak. In this case, your character can communicate using the sign languages associated with the languages she selects, as well as being able to read and write the written forms of those languages.


        When you first choose your character’s languages, you must decide whether she knows the sign language versions of all of her languages or their spoken versions. If you choose sign language instead of spoken language, your character receives Read Lips (see page 170) as a bonus feat. However, if your character is unable to speak, that feat may not convey the ability to speak. A deaf or hard of hearing character can’t use hearing as an imprecise sense (see page 301). Should your character lose or gain her sense of hearing during the game, she can spend downtime retraining her languages from spoken to signed or vice versa. If you’re playing a hearing character who would know one or more sign languages as a result of her backstory (for example, a hearing character with a deaf parent), you may get Sign Language (see page 171) as a bonus feat at the GM’s discretion.


        Sign languages typically require both hands to convey more than basic concepts, and they require direct visual attention to understand. Since they are quiet, they are ideal for infiltrations in exploration mode, but the required attention makes them extremely difficult to understand in combat. Much as a character can’t engage in complex spoken dialogue while swinging a sword, a character can’t communicate a hefty amount of information in sign language during combat, but simple concepts such as designating a target, mocking a foe, or signaling an ally to look out can be conveyed through signs as easily as shouted words. Using sign language in some situations, such as areas of low visibility, can be tricky—just as it can be difficult to communicate verbally in a noisy environment.

        Learning a new language affords your character opportunities, particularly if you choose a language to fit the adventure, such as learning Undercommon before an adventure in the Darklands. While in most cases you can eventually find an NPC who also speaks Common, knowing the language yourself allows you to hear what the NPCs are saying to each other and appeal to NPCs other than your translator. Your whole party could even learn a little-known language that you use for secret communications!

        Just as your character’s ancestry plays a key role in expressing her identity and worldview, her class indicates the training she has developed and will improve upon as an adventurer. Groups of players often wish to create characters whose skills and abilities synergize mechanically, and in this respect, choosing your character’s class is perhaps the most important decision you will make for her.

        Although there are a limited number of character classes from which you can choose, there are unlimited character concepts that these rules allow you to bring to life. Perhaps your character is a brilliant but scatterbrained alchemist who can rattle off complex formulas for alchemical items but has trouble remembering his best friend’s birthday. Or perhaps she’s a muscle-bound swordswoman who becomes as immovable as a mountain when she hoists a shield. Maybe your character is a hot-tempered sorcerer whose gesticulating fingers pulse with light from an angelic ancestor. The choices you make for your character within her class—such as a cleric’s choice of god, a fighter’s choice of weapon, or a sorcerer’s bloodline— bring these visions to life within the context of the rules.


        The following entries describe Pathfinder’s 12 core classes, containing the information you need to play a character of that class from level 1 to 20. Once you choose your character’s class, the game’s rules provide optional archetypes that allow you to further customize her abilities, though these rules (described on page 279) are not recommended for beginners. Additionally, the game includes multiclass archetypes that allow her to gain abilities from other classes.

        Each class entry includes information about typical members of the class, as well as suggestions for roleplaying characters of that class and playing such characters in the game’s various modes. Each class provides your character with an ability boost in a key ability score, a number of Hit Points she receives at each level, her proficiencies in various abilities and equipment, signature skills in which she can excel, special abilities from her class features, and more. Your character’s class entry also provides all of the information needed when she gains levels, so it will be a vital reference to you throughout the course of your campaign.

        This is the ability score that you’ll use to determine the Difficulty Class (DC) associated with your character’s class features or feats. This is called your class DC. If your character is of a spellcasting class, this key ability is also used to calculate spell DCs and similar values. Most classes are associated with one key ability score, but some require you to choose from two options.


        Additionally, when you choose your character’s class, she gains an ability boost in her key ability. For more about ability boosts, see page 43.

        Each time your character gains a level, she receives an additional number of Hit Points equal to this number plus her Constitution modifier. For more about calculating your character’s Constitution modifier and determining her Hit Points, see page 14.

        This lists the degree to which your character is trained in key aspects of the game’s mechanics. This training is called her proficiency rank, and your character’s proficiency rank in a mechanic determines her modifier when she makes a roll using that mechanic. Proficiency ranks range from untrained to legendary, and the associated modifiers range from your character’s level minus 2 to her level plus 3. For more about proficiency ranks, see page 8.


        Each class entry typically specifies your character’s proficiency rank in Perception, saving throws, weapons, and armor. If a mechanic isn’t listed in your character’s class entry, her proficiency rank in that mechanic is considered untrained unless she gains training from another source.


        Additionally, this section indicates the number of skills in which your character is trained. When you choose your character’s class, you also select a number of skills equal to this number; your character gains the trained proficiency rank in those skills. If your character has a high Intelligence score, she’s trained in a higher number of skills.


        Spellcasting classes provide proficiency in spells, which is further detailed in each class’s entry.

        You gain the Alchemical Crafting feat (see page 162), even if you don’t meet that feat’s prerequisites, and you gain the four additional common 1st-level alchemical formulas that feat grants. The list of alchemical items begins on page 360. You can use this feat to create common alchemical items as long as you have their formulas in your formula book, though their power is fleeting. You can create these items in two different ways, as described below. An alchemical item you create this way has the infused trait. First, during your daily preparations (described on page 332), you can create items for which you have the formulas. Creating items in this way requires spending 1 Resonance Point to create a batch of alchemical items of that type with the infused trait. You select how many items are in the batch, up to half the normal maximum batch size (half a typical batch is two items, but see the Crafting Trained Activities section on page for more information). You don’t need to attempt a Crafting check to do this, and you ignore the number of days typically required to create the items and any requirements of alchemical reagents. You can’t overspend Resonance Points to create infused items in this way during your daily preparations.


        Second, you can create alchemical items with the Quick Alchemy action, described below.

        Each time you gain a new level, you can add formulas for two alchemical items to your formula book. These can be of any level of item you can create.

When you throw an alchemical item of 3rd level or higher with the bomb and splash traits, you can choose for the bomb’s splash damage to deal extra damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 0) instead of the normal amount.

        Because of the great amount of time you’ve spent studying and experimenting, you know how to scale up your formulas to larger batches without giving them any additional attention. When spending downtime to Craft alchemical items, you can produce twice the number of alchemical items in a single batch without needing to spend additional preparatory time. For instance, if you are crafting elixirs of life, you can craft up to four elixirs in a single batch using downtime, rather than two. This does not reduce the amount of required alchemical reagents or other ingredients needed to craft each item, nor does it increase your rate of progress for days past the base downtime spent. This also does not change the number of items you can create in a batch with advanced alchemy.

        When using Quick Alchemy to craft an alchemical item with the bomb trait, you can build it to explode automatically after a certain amount of time. This delay can be any number of rounds up to your level, chosen when you craft the bomb. When this delayed bomb explodes, it deals damage to a creature within its square as if that creature had been hit by an attack with the bomb (if there are multiple creatures in the square, choose the target randomly). It also deals its splash damage (if any) as if you had thrown the bomb at the target.

        Unlike other items crafted with the Quick Alchemy action, the delayed bomb remains potent until it explodes or you defuse it. You can use the Interact action with a delayed bomb you made in order to defuse it. Other creatures can try to Disable a Device to defuse the bomb, using your class DC for the Thievery check.

If you use the specific antidote on yourself and you have the formula for the poison or venom affecting you, increase the counteract level of the specific antidote by 1.

For example, you can combine two of the same elixirs to create a combined elixir of life that heals double the amount. If a creature other than you drinks a combined elixir, it must spend 2 Resonance Points to gain the effects instead of only 1 Resonance Point.

On a success, the poison is applied to the target. On a failure, the poison is wasted.

Whenever you use any alchemical item with the bomb trait, it responds to you as if it were infused and you were the one who created it. Whenever you use any mutagen, you also treat it as if it were infused and attuned to you.

        Rage consumes you in battle. You delight in carving through your enemies using powerful weapons and wreaking havoc, relying on astonishing durability, without needing complicated techniques or rigid training. You associate your rage with a traditional symbol of affinity known as a totem, which might take the form of an animal, a spirit, or a part of yourself. To many barbarians, brute force is a hammer and every problem looks like a nail, whereas others try to hold back the dark emotions inside them and release them only when it matters most.

General feats also include skill feats, which expand on what you can accomplish via skills. Most characters gain skill feats at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter; see your class for details.

        You can spend the day Gathering Information specifically about deals on items rather than other information. Name an item or a general category of items (such as “magic weapons”) you’re looking for and then roll your Diplomacy check. Any bonuses you have when Gathering Information apply. The GM sets the DC based on the population of the settlement, the difficulty of finding the easiest-to-find item, how many merchants are in the area, and similar factors. If you choose not to buy the item using a deal right away, the GM determines whether the deal is still good later on. This type of Gather Information action has special outcomes on a success or critical success.


        You can also use the Practice a Trade activity with Diplomacy instead of the Lore skill, spending your days hunting bargains and reselling at a profit.

This works only once per conversation, and if you get critical successes against multiple targets using the same result, you choose which creature’s attitude to improve. You must be lying in a way that appears to impart important information­—in other words, your lie must make the target grateful for your supposed help, which trivial or irrelevant lies can’t achieve.

        Even after you are caught in falsehoods, you pile lie upon lie. Reduce the bonus a target gets for your previous attempts to Create a Diversion or Lie to it from +4 to +2. If you’re a master in Deception, reduce the bonus to +1. If you’re legendary in Deception, your web of lies is so effective that your targets don’t get these bonuses at all.

        You have social connections you can leverage to trade favors or meet important people. Whenever you’re in an area where you have connections (typically in a settlement where you’ve spent downtime building connections, or possibly in another settlement in the same nation), you can attempt a Society check to either arrange a meeting with an important political figure or attempt to get a favor in exchange for a later favor of your contact’s choice. The GM decides the DC of the Society check based on the difficulty of the favor and the prominence of the figure.

        You either were raised among the nobility or have learned proper etiquette and bearing as well as noble lineages, allowing you to present yourself as a member of the nobility. You can use the Recall Knowledge action with Society to gain useful facts about these topics, using the DC for Nobility Lore if it is lower, and you can use your Society modifier on all Nobility Lore checks. If you want to impersonate a specific noble or create a false noble backstory for yourself, you still need to additionally use Deception when presenting yourself in your noble persona.

        You often smuggle things past the authorities. When the GM rolls your Stealth check to see if a passive observer notices a small item you have concealed, she uses the number rolled or 10, whichever is higher. If you’re a master in Stealth, she uses the number rolled or 15, and if you’re legendary in Stealth, you automatically succeed at hiding a small concealed item from a passive observer. This provides no benefits when a creature attempts a Perception check while actively searching you for hidden items. Due to your skill at smuggling, you are more likely to find more lucrative smuggling tasks when using Underworld Lore to Practice a Trade.

        Tracking is second nature to you, and when necessary you can follow a trail without pause. You can Track while moving at full Speed by taking a –5 penalty to your Survival check.

If you succeed, the target is fascinated with you for 1 round; if the observer is in a situation that demands immediate attention, such as combat, you must critically succeed to fascinate the target. You must choose which creature you’re attempting to fascinate before you roll your check, and regardless of your result, the target is bolstered against your Fascinating Performance. If you’re an expert in Performance, you can compare your check result to the Will DCs of up to four observers and fascinate any number of them. If you’re a master in Performance you can fascinate up to 10 observers with a single check, and if you’re legendary in Performance you can try to fascinate any number of observers at the same time.

        Your body bounces back from extreme situations much more quickly than most. You recover twice as many Hit Points from resting. Each time you succeed at a Fortitude save against an ongoing toxin, you reduce its stage by 2, or by 1 against a virulent toxin. Each critical success you achieve against an ongoing toxin reduces its stage by 3, or by 2 against a virulent toxin. In addition, you reduce the severity of your drained condition by 2 when you rest for a night instead of by 1. You reduce your enervated condition by 2 when you succeed at your Fortitude save or spend a day of downtime training, and by 3 when you critically succeed at your Fortitude save. For more information on these conditions, see page 321.

        While Surviving in the Wilderness during downtime, you can always find enough food and water to provide yourself a subsistence living (provided you aren’t in an area that’s completely lacking in appropriate resources). If you are trained but not better, finding food and water for another or providing a comfortable living still requires you to attempt Survival checks and hope for a critical success; on any other successful result, you still find only enough for your own subsistence.


        If you’re an expert, even without rolling you can always find enough food and water for your own comfortable living or subsistence living for yourself and one other creature that eats roughly as much as a human, and on a critical success you find enough for a second additional creature.


        If you’re a master, you can always find enough for comfortable living for yourself and one other or subsistence living for yourself and two others without rolling, and you can provide for twice as many others on a critical success.


        If you’re legendary, you can always find enough for comfortable living for yourself and four others or subsistence living for yourself and eight others without rolling, but a critical success provides no additional benefit.


        Multiple smaller creatures or creatures with significantly smaller appetites than a human are counted as a single creature for this feat, and larger creatures or those with significantly greater appetite each count as multiple creatures. The GM determines how much a particular non-human creature needs to eat.

        First impressions are your strong suit. When you meet someone, you can immediately attempt a Diplomacy check to Make an Impression with a –5 penalty rather than needing to converse for 1 minute. On a success, you don’t gain any further benefit for spending 1 minute in conversation, but if you fail or critically fail, you can engage in 1 minute of conversation and attempt a new check at the end of that time rather than accepting the failure or critical failure result. This functions only when you meet someone in a social situation, not if you encounter them in a hostile situation such as a combat encounter.

        You are a genius at Crafting, easily able to determine how things are made and create new inventions. You can spend downtime to invent a common formula that you don’t know. This works just like the Craft skill: you spend a number of days in preparation and half the Price of the formula up front, roll a Crafting check, and on a success either finish the formula by paying the difference or work for longer to decrease the Price. The difference is that you spend the additional time in research, design, and development, rather than in creating an item.

        You’ve invented new medical procedures or discovered ancient techniques that can achieve nearly miraculous results. Once per day for each target, you can spend 1 hour treating the target and attempt a Medicine check to remove a disease or the blinded, deafened, drained, or enervated condition. Use the DC of the disease or of the spell or effect that created the condition. If the effect’s source is an artifact, a creature above 20th level, or other similarly powerful source, increase the DC by 5.

        Your ability to steal items defies belief. You can attempt to Steal an Object that is actively wielded or that would be extremely noticeable or time-consuming to remove (like worn shoes or armor). You must do so slowly and carefully, spending at least 1 minute and significantly longer for items that are normally time-consuming to remove (like armor). Throughout this duration you must have some means of staying hidden, whether under cover of darkness or in a bustling crowd, for example. You take a –5 penalty on your Thievery check. Even if you succeed, if the item is extremely prominent, like a suit of full plate armor, onlookers will quickly notice it’s gone after you steal it.

        When you critically succeed using Deception to Create a Diversion, you continue to remain only sensed after the end of your turn. This effect lasts for an amount of time depending on the diversion and the situation, as determined by the GM (but for a minimum of 1 additional round).

        For instance, if Merisiel runs away after throwing a rock in the opposite direction to make noise and achieves a critical success on her Deception check, the guards might continue chasing in the direction of the rock until they either give up pursuit or notice consequences of Merisiel’s later actions.

        Learning new spells comes easily to you. Choose arcane, divine, occult, or primal; you can choose a magic tradition only if you are an expert in the associated skill. You take only 10 minutes per spell level to learn a spell of that type, rather than 1 hour per spell level. If you fail to learn a spell of that type, you can try to learn it again after 1 week or after you gain a level, whichever comes first. If you’re a master in the chosen type of magic’s associated skill, learning a spell takes only 5 minutes per spell level, and if you’re legendary in that skill, it takes only 1 minute per spell level.

        You can spend 10 minutes applying natural cures to heal a creature, after which you must attempt a DC 20 Nature check. On a success, the target regains Hit Points equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom modifier. If you’re a master of Nature, the target regains an additional 1d8 Hit Points. You can use this feat to heal a particular creature only once per day.


        If you’re in the wilderness, you might have easier access to fresh ingredients, allowing you to restore an additional 1d8 Hit Points on a success or critical success, subject to the GM’s determination.

For instance, you can forage for food even if the plane lacks food that could normally sustain you, and you could find your bearings on a plane that doesn’t have stars, a sun, or other normal aids to navigation. A success at Surviving in the Wild can reduce the plane’s damage as well, at the GM’s discretion.

In encounter mode or when attempting a more difficult feat of lip reading, you are fascinated and flat-footed during each round in which you focus on the lip movements, and you must succeed at a Society check (DC determined by the GM) to successfully read someone’s lips in such circumstances.


        If you are deaf or hard of hearing and have Read Lips, you recognize the lip movements for the spoken form of your languages. You can also speak the spoken form of your languages clearly enough for others to understand you, so long as you can produce sound vocally.

        You can write spells onto scrolls, allowing you to cast them later without spending a spell slot. You use the Craft activity as described on page 148, but you can make only scrolls. Instead of attempting a Crafting check, you attempt a check with the appropriate skill for the spell’s tradition—Arcana for a spell on the arcane spell list, Nature for a primal spell, Occultism for an occult spell, and Religion for a divine spell. If a spell appears on multiple spell lists, you can choose which of the applicable skills to use.


        You must have access to a spell in order to scribe it onto a scroll.

        Your training focused on Crafting one particular kind of item. Select one of the specialties listed below; you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Crafting checks to Craft items of that type. If it’s unclear whether the specialty applies, the GM decides. Some specialties might only partially apply. For example, if you were making a morningstar and had specialty in woodworking, the GM might give you half your bonus because the item requires both blacksmithing and woodworking.

        If you use Palm an Object or Steal an Object on a scroll, spellbook, or similar item, you can remove the magical writing without disturbing the parchment or other surface it was inscribed upon. When you do, you must have a blank scroll or page in your possession that you can transfer the magical writing onto, or else the magic is expended and lost. The GM usually applies a penalty to observers’ Perception checks and DCs to notice the theft, unless the writing is on open display (in the case of an unfurled scroll, for example). You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check because you don’t need to collect the entire object. However, higher-level magic is harder to steal, so the DC is increased by the spell’s level.

Additionally, if you first Create a Diversion using Deception, taking a single Palm an Object or Steal an Object action doesn’t end your unseen condition.

        You examine a magic item you would normally not be able to use—for example, a fighter normally couldn’t use a scroll, staff, or wand—in an effort to fool the item and activate it temporarily. Attempt a check with a skill DC of the item’s level (typically the low-difficulty DC, but the GM could adjust this at their discretion), using the skill that matches the item’s magic tradition (Arcana for a spell on the arcane spell list, Nature for a primal spell, Occultism for an occult spell, and Religion for a divine spell). You must have identified the magic item (or had it identified for you) in order to activate it this way. If you activate a magic item that requires your spell roll or spell DC and you don’t have the ability to cast spells of the relevant type (such as arcane or divine), you have the untrained proficiency rank and can use the highest of your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma modifiers. If you’re a master in the appropriate skill for that magical tradition, you’re treated as having the trained proficiency rank instead. If the spell’s tradition depends on the caster’s class or requires her to have the spell on her spell list, you choose which class you’re attempting to emulate.

        This skill measures how much you know about alchemy, arcane spells, and the most common magic items. Further, it determines how much information you have on theories about alchemy and arcane energies as well as lore about the creatures associated with them.


        If you’re trained in Arcana, regardless of whether or not you’re an alchemist or a spellcaster, you’re versed in how to identify alchemical and magic items, even those you normally would not be able to use.


        You can use Arcana in the following way, even if you are untrained in the skill.

If your attempt is interrupted, you must start over. The GM sets the DC for your check (see Table 4–2 on page 146). Cursed or esoteric subjects usually have higher DCs or might even be impossible to identify using Arcana alone. Heightening a spell doesn’t increase the DC.

        remain in conversation with the person who knows the spell
        or have the magical writing in your possession.

        You can make an item from raw materials. The GM determines the DC to Craft an item, which is based on its level, quality, and rarity, and might be affected by other circumstances. You need the Alchemical Crafting skill feat (page 162) to create alchemical items, the Magical Crafting skill feat (page 168) to create magic items, and the Snare Crafting feat (page 171) to create snares.


        To Craft an item, you must meet the following requirements:
        •	 The item is your level or lower. (An item that doesn’t list a level is level 0.)
        •	 You have the proficiency rank appropriate to the item’s quality. (See page 190.)
        •	 You have the formula for the item.
        •	 You have an appropriate set of tools and, in many cases, a workshop. For example, you need access to a smithy to forge a metal shield.
        •	 You must supply raw materials worth at least half the item’s
        Price. You always expend at least that amount of raw materials when you Craft successfully. If you’re in a settlement, you can usually spend currency to get an equal amount of raw materials you need, except in the case of rarer special materials.


        You need to spend a minimum number of downtime days to Craft your item to a basic state of completion. This number depends on your level and the level of the item. You need to spend 4 downtime days for an item of your level. Reduce the number of days by 1 for each level by which your level exceeds the item’s level, to a minimum of 1 day. After spending this base number of days, you can either expend more materials to complete the item immediately or spend more days Crafting, completing the item more slowly but at lower cost. The success entry explains this mechanic further.


        You can Craft items with the consumable trait in batches, making up to four of the same item simultaneously. This requires you to include the raw materials for all the items in the batch at the start, and you must complete the batch all at once.


        After you expend the required amount of raw materials and base downtime, attempt a Crafting check. If you fail or critically fail, you can try to Craft the item again, but you have to start over.

        Your attempt to create the item is successful. You can pay the remaining half of the item’s Price to complete it immediately, or spend additional downtime days working on it. For each additional day you spend, reduce the value of the materials you need to expend to complete the item by an amount based on your level and proficiency rank (see Table 4–3). After any of these downtime days, you can complete the item by spending the remaining amount. If your downtime days are interrupted, you can return to finish the item later, continuing right where you left off.

        You create a disguise to pass yourself off as someone or something you are not. Putting together a decent disguise takes 10 minutes and requires a disguise kit (see page 184), but a simpler, quicker disguise might do the job if you’re not trying to imitate a specific individual, at the GM’s discretion.


        In most cases, creatures have a chance to detect you only if they use the Seek action to roll Perception checks against your Deception DC. If you attempt to directly interact with someone while disguised, you need to roll a secret Deception check against that creature’s Perception DC instead. If you’re disguised as a specific individual, the GM might give creatures you interact with a bonus based on how well they know the person you’re imitating, or ask you to roll a secret Deception check even if you aren’t directly interacting with them.

        You try to fool someone with an untruth. Doing so takes at least 1 round, or longer if the lie is elaborate. You roll a single Deception check and compare it against the Perception DC of every creature you are trying to fool. The GM may modify this DC based on the situation and the nature of the lie you are trying to tell. Elaborate or highly unbelievable lies are much harder to get a creature to believe than simpler and more believable lies, and some lies are so big it’s impossible to get anyone to believe them.


        At the GM’s discretion, if a creature initially believes your lie, it might still be able to attempt a Perception check against your Deception DC (success on the creature’s part gains the failure effect below) to realize it’s a lie. This usually happens if the creature discovers enough evidence to counter your statements.

        You have specialized information on a narrow topic. Lore is different than other skills in two ways.


        First, the lore skill features many subcategories. You might have Military Lore, Sailing Lore, Vampire Lore, or any similar subcategory of skill. Each subcategory counts as its own skill, so applying a skill increase to Planar Lore wouldn’t increase your modifier with Sailing Lore. You gain a subcategory of the Lore skill from your background. The GM determines what other subcategories she’ll allow as Lore skills, though these categories are always less broad than any of the other skills that allow you to Recall Knowledge, and they should never be able to fully take the place of another skill’s ability to Recall Knowledge. For instance, you couldn’t choose Magic Lore in an attempt to recall the same breadth of knowledge covered by Arcana or Adventuring Lore in an attempt to gain all the information an adventurer would need.


        Second, all of your Lore skills are signature skills (see page 144). This means that you can advance them to expert or legendary proficiency if you so choose.


        If you have multiple subcategories of Lore that could apply to a check, or that would overlap with another skill in the circumstances, you can choose to use the skill with the better skill modifier or that you would prefer to use. If there’s any doubt whether a Lore skill applies to a specific topic or use, the GM decides whether it can be used or not.


        You can perform the following action using any category of Lore, even if you are untrained in any Lore skill or a certain category of Lore.

        You apply the practical benefits of your Lore specialty to earn money during periods of downtime. Practicing a Trade is most effective with Lore specialties such as business, law, or sailing, where there’s demand for workers. The GM might increase the DC if you’re attempting to use an obscure Lore skill to practice a trade.


        The GM assigns a task level representing the difficulty of the most lucrative job available. You can go looking for lower-level tasks, with the GM determining whether you find any. Sometimes you can attempt to find better work than the initial offerings, though this requires spending downtime to Gather Information or researching and socializing.


        When you take on a job, the GM sets the DC of your Lore check. The amount of money you can earn depends on the task level and your proficiency rank, as listed on Table 4–4: Skill Income. You might also need specialized tools to accept a job, like mining tools to work in a mine or a merchant’s scale to buy and sell valuables in a market.


        You need to spend a minimum number of downtime days to locate and secure the job, prepare to practice your trade, and get started on the task. This number depends on your level and the level of the task. You must spend 4 downtime days for a task of your level. Reduce the number of days by 1 for each level lower than you the task is, to a minimum of 1 day. Conversely, increase the number of days by 1 for each level higher than you the task is. After this base downtime, you earn your initial amount of money, and you can continue at the task to keep earning more. The success entry explains how this works. Note that if you want to earn money for working just 1 day, you need to pick a task that requires only 1 day of preparation. A 0-level task always requires 1 day.


        After you spend the base downtime to get started, roll your Lore check to determine your earnings. You continue to earn that amount each day for the duration of the job, without requiring further checks. The GM determines how long the job lasts, which is limited by how long the task will take to complete and other factors. Most tasks last a week or two, though some can take months or even years. If you stop in the middle of a task, normally you have to find a new task when you return, but the GM might decide that you can pick up where you left off (which usually happens only if the job is incomplete and the setup you did is still applicable).

        You issue an order to an animal that’s obeying you, either because you previously used Handle an Animal successfully (see below) or you have the Ride feat (see page 170). Most animals know the Leap, Seek, Stand, Stride, and Strike basic actions. If an animal knows an activity, such as a horse’s Gallop, you can command the animal to perform the activity, but you must spend as many Command an Animal actions as the activity’s number of actions. The animal uses the action you command.


        Most animals understand only the simplest instructions, so you might be able to instruct your animal to move to a certain square but not dictate a specific path to get there, or command it to attack a certain creature but not to make its attack nonlethal. The GM decides the specifics of the action your animal uses.

        If you are an occult spellcaster, you can gain access to a new occult spell from someone who knows that spell or from magical writing like a spellbook or scroll.


        To learn the spell, you must do the following.
        •	 Spend 1 hour per level of the spell, during which you must remain in conversation with the person who knows the spell or have the magical writing in your possession.
        •	 Have an amount of magical materials with a value indicated in Table 4–2 on page 146.
        •	 Attempt an Occultism check with a DC determined by the GM (see Table 4–2).

        You can read and understand occult writing, including complex metaphysical systems, syncretic principles, and incoherent ramblings, as long as it is in a language you can normally read. This usually takes about 1 minute per page of text. To read and understand the nuances of particularly archaic, esoteric, or obscure texts, the GM may require you to attempt an Occultism check to see if you understand the true meaning of the esoterica. The GM might have you attempt one check for the entire text or one check for each section of a larger text.

        During downtime, you perform for an audience to make money. The GM determines the levels of the audiences available and gives you a brief description of the most discerning (high-level) audience you could perform for. You can go looking for lower-level audiences, with the GM determining whether you find any. Sometimes you can attempt to find better audiences, though this requires spending downtime to Gather Information or researching and socializing. A typical audience of commoners on the street is a 0-level audience, but a group of artisans with more refined tastes might be a 2nd- or 3rd-level audience, and merchants, nobility, and royalty are increasingly higher level. The level of your audience is the task level for your performance.


        When you choose your audience, the GM secretly sets the DC of your Performance check. The amount of money you can earn depends on the task level and your proficiency rank, as listed on Table 4–4: Skill Income (see page 153).


        You need to spend a minimum number of downtime days to prepare for your performance, get out word to increase demand, allow time for the audience to plan attending, and play your first show. The exact number of days depends on your level and the level of the task. You must spend 4 downtime days for a task of your level. Reduce the number of days by 1 for each level lower than you the task is, to a minimum of 1 day. Conversely, increase the number of days by 1 for each level higher than you the task is. After this base duration, you earn your initial amount of money, and you can continue performing over subsequent days to keep earning more. The success entry explains how this works. Note that if you want to earn money for performing for just 1 day, you need to pick an audience that requires you to spend only 1 day of preparation. Performing for a 0-level audience always requires 1 day.

        After you spend the base downtime to get started, roll your Performance check to determine your earnings. If you do well, the GM might determine you can extend your performance, working more shows to bring in more money; this does not require further checks. Eventually, however, your performance will end because you’ve exhausted your audiences. The GM might let you perform the same show for other audiences, reducing or eliminating the preparation time but lowering the task level.


        Most performances can be staged for a couple weeks, or longer if you perform rarely and do other things with the rest of your downtime. Sometimes, taking time off from performing a show can draw in new high-level audiences, though this usually means you have to spend some time preparing again since you’re rusty.

        You create a forged document, usually over the course of several hours, a day, or a week. You must have the proper writing material to create a forgery. If the document’s handwriting doesn’t need to be specific to a person, you need only to have seen a similar document before, and you gain up to a +4 circumstance bonus to the check (the GM determines the bonus). To forge a specific person’s handwriting, you need a sample of that person’s handwriting.


        Once someone observes the document, the GM rolls your Society check. If the result exceeds 20, the GM compares it to the observer’s Society DC. If the result is 20 or lower, the observer uses Perception or Society, whichever is higher. An observer who is closely scrutinizing documents on the lookout for a forgery can attempt a Perception or Society check against your Society DC (if they succeed, they know your document is a forgery). Once the GM rolls your check for a document, that same result is used no matter how many creatures observe that document.

        You can also conceal an object somewhere other than your person, such as among undergrowth or in a secret compartment within a piece of furniture. In this case, characters Seeking in an area compare their Perception check results to your Stealth DC to determine whether they find the object.

        You can attempt to move to another place while becoming or staying unseen. Stride up to half your Speed. (You can use Sneak while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type.) The GM rolls your Stealth check in secret and compares the result to the Perception DCs of creatures that you were sensed or unseen by at the start of your movement.


        You automatically become seen if you don’t have cover or aren’t concealed from them at any time during your movement, or as soon as you do anything other than Hide or Sneak. The GM might allow you to perform a particularly unobtrusive action, activity, free action, or reaction without being noticed, possibly requiring another Stealth check. If you speak or make a deliberate loud noise, you become sensed. If you do anything else, you become seen just before you act. For instance, if you attack a creature you’re unseen by, that creature is not flat- footed against that attack.


        If you’re unseen by a creature and it’s impossible for that creature to see you (such as when you’re invisible, the observer is blinded, or you’re in darkness and the creature can’t see in darkness), you automatically treat the result of your d20 roll as a 20 against that creature on your checks to Sneak. You also continue to be unseen if you lose cover against or are no longer concealed from such a creature. Acting to do something other than Hide or Sneak makes you sensed instead of seen. If a creature senses you via Seek, you must Sneak to become unseen by it again.

        Stealing a small (usually of negligible Bulk) object from another person can be very difficult. If the object is worn but relatively unattended (like a loosely carried pouch filled with coins, or an object within such a pouch), the DC to steal the item without detection is equal to the creature’s Perception DC. You can’t steal an object that’s more closely guarded (in a pocket, for example), nor can you steal from a creature who is in combat or otherwise on guard. The GM determines the response of any creature that notices your theft.


        The GM might impose a penalty on your check if the nature of the object makes it harder to steal (such as a very small item in a large pack, or a sheet of parchment mixed in with other documents). The GM can also penalize the Perception DC of observers if they’re distracted.

        Your character starts out with 150 silver pieces (sp) to spend on any common items from this chapter. Items with an uncommon rarity can only be bought with special access or GM permission. If you’re playing a spellcaster and want to buy magic items (like potions, scrolls, or holy water) or an alchemist and want to buy alchemical items, your GM can give you permission to buy those, and she will tell you which items you can choose from and how much they cost.


        Once you’ve purchased your starting items, there are three main ways to gain new items and equipment: you can find them during an adventure, make them with the Crafting skill, or purchase them from a merchant.

        Though you might be able to barter valuable items in some areas, currency is the most versatile way to make transactions when you head to market. The most common currency is coin. For most commoners and beginning adventurers, the standard unit is the silver piece (sp). Each silver piece is of a standard weight of silver and is typically accepted by any merchant or kingdom no matter where it was minted. There are three other types of common coins, each likewise standardized in weight and value. The first is the copper piece (cp). Each copper piece is worth one-tenth of a silver piece. The gold piece (gp) is often used for purchasing magic items and other expensive items, as 1 gold piece is worth 10 silver pieces or 100 copper pieces. The platinum piece (pp) is used by nobles to demonstrate their wealth, for the purchase of very expensive items, or simply as a way to easily transport large sums of currency. A platinum piece is worth 10 gold pieces, 100 silver pieces, or 1,000 copper pieces. See Table 6–1: Coin Values for the exchange rates of common types of coins.

        Coins are popular due to their portability. A thousand coins of any denomination or combination of denominations count as 1 Bulk (see below). It’s not usually necessary to determine the Bulk of coins in fractions of 1,000. In other words, 100 coins don’t count as a light item, and 1,999 coins count as 1 Bulk, not 2.

        Most items in the following tables have a Price, which is the amount of currency it typically takes to purchase that item. However, some of the items listed have an inherent or otherwise meaningless cost, indicated with “—”. This typically indicates that an entry can’t be purchased. An item with a “0” Price indicates that it is normally free, but its value could be higher based on its quality or the composition of its materials. Most items can be sold for half their Price, but coins and raw materials (such as crafting components) can be exchanged for their full Price.

        Each item has an item level, which represents the complexity of the item and any magic used in its construction. Simpler items with a lower level are easier to construct, and you can’t Craft items that have a higher level than your own (see page 148). If an item’s level isn’t listed, its level is 0. While characters can use items of any level, Game Masters should keep in mind that allowing characters access to items far above their current level may imbalance the game.

        A character typically has two hands, allowing her to hold an item in each hand or a single two-handed item using both hands. Drawing or changing how you’re carrying an item usually requires an Interact action (dropping items instead uses the Drop action). Table 6–2: Changing Equipment lists some ways that you might change the items you’re holding or carrying, and the number of hands you need to do so. Many ways to use items cost multiple actions. For example, drinking a potion stowed in your belt pouch requires drawing it with an Interact action and drinking it with an Operate Activation action.

        Especially heavy or unwieldy items can make it more difficult for you to move swiftly, as can overloading yourself with too much gear. The Bulk value of an item reflects how difficult an item is to handle, representing both weight and the size of the item. In most cases, you don’t need to worry about Bulk unless you’re carrying numerous substantial items or you have a low Strength score.

        Items may have a number to indicate their Bulk value, or may be light (indicated by an L) or negligible for the purpose of determining Bulk (indicated by a —). For instance, full plate armor is 4 Bulk, a longsword is 1 Bulk, a dagger or scroll is light, and a piece of chalk is negligible. Ten light items count as 1 Bulk, and you don’t count fractions (so 9 light items count as 0, and 11 items count as 1). Items of negligible Bulk don’t count toward Bulk unless you try to carry vast numbers of them, as determined by the GM.

        An item can be destroyed if it takes damage enough times. An item reduces any damage dealt to it by its Hardness. The Hardness of various materials is explained in the Materials section on page 354. If an item takes damage equal to or exceeding the item’s Hardness, the item takes a Dent. If the item takes damage equal to or greater than twice its Hardness in one hit, it takes 2 Dents. For instance, a wooden shield (Hardness 3) that takes 10 damage would take 2 Dents. A typical item can take only 1 Dent without becoming broken. A second Dent causes it to become broken, though it can still be repaired. An item that would take a Dent or become broken while already broken is destroyed beyond salvage. Some magical or especially sturdy items can take more than 1 Dent before becoming broken, as noted in their descriptions.

        Broken is a condition that affects objects. A broken object can’t be used for its normal function, nor does it grant bonuses. It still imposes all penalties normally incurred by carrying, holding, or wearing it. For example, a suit of armor would still impose its Dexterity modifier cap, check penalty, and so forth. Broken armor is an exception. It still grants its item bonuses, but also gives you a conditional penalty to AC depending on its category: –1 for broken light armor, –2 for broken medium armor, or –3 for broken heavy armor.

        Your Armor Class (AC) measures how well you can defend against attacks. Your Touch Armor Class (TAC) protects against attacks that need only to touch you. Your Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity modifier (up to your armor’s Dexterity modifier cap) plus your proficiency modifier for any armor or shield you are using plus the armor’s item bonus to AC. If you’re using both armor and a shield, apply the lower of the two proficiency modifiers. If you’re not wearing armor, substitute your proficiency in unarmored defense. Your Touch Armor Class uses the same calculation, except you add your armor’s item bonus to TAC instead of its bonus to AC. Some spells, magic item, and abilities give your character a bonus or penalty to AC. These also apply to TAC unless stated otherwise. - type: variable_text

The shield’s check penalty applies whenever you’re wielding the shield, regardless of whether the shield is raised.

        If you want to reliably use your shield to attack, you need to buy and attach a shield boss or shield spikes to the shield. These work like other weapons, and can even be etched with runes (see page 370).

        Most characters in Pathfinder likely carry some kind of weapon, whether a keen-edged dagger, a mighty warhammer, a graceful bow, or even a simple club. Full details on how you calculate your bonuses, penalties, and modifiers for attack rolls and damage rolls are given in Chapter 1 on page 17, but they are summarized here.

        When making an attack, determine the result of your attack roll by rolling a d20 and adding your attack modifier with the weapon or unarmed attack you’re using. Your melee attack modifier is the sum of your proficiency modifier with a weapon plus your Strength modifier (or optionally, your Dexterity modifier for weapons with the finesse trait). Your ranged attack modifier is the sum of your proficiency modifier with a weapon plus your Dexterity modifier. Bonuses and penalties apply to these rolls just like with other types of checks. Magic weapons and weapons of expert quality or better add an item bonus to your attack rolls.

        If you attack more than once on the same turn, your attacks after the first take a penalty called a multiple attack penalty. Your second attack takes a –5 penalty, and any subsequent attacks take a –10 penalty. This penalty is untyped and is cumulative with all other penalties. The penalty doesn’t apply to attacks you take when it isn’t your turn (such as attacks made as part of a reaction), though these attacks often have their own penalty. You can choose a weapon with the agile trait to reduce your multiple attack penalty (see page 182).

        You can Strike with your fist or another body part, calculating your attack and damage rolls in the same way you would with a weapon. This counts as a simple weapon, so almost all characters start out trained in unarmed attacks. Use the statistics for a fist even if you’re kicking, kneeing, or attacking with another part of your body. Some ancestry feats, class features, class feats, and spells give access to special, more powerful unarmed attacks.

        When the result of your attack roll with a weapon or unarmed attack is equal to or exceeds your target’s AC, roll the weapon or unarmed attack’s damage die to determine the damage you deal. If you’re making a melee attack, you add your Strength modifier to the damage. Ranged weapons usually use only the weapon’s damage die, though weapons with the propulsive trait sometimes add half your Strength modifier, and thrown weapons add your full Strength modifier.


        Magic weapons add one or more weapon damage dice to your damage roll. These extra dice are the same die size as the weapon’s damage die.

        When you make an attack and roll a natural 20 (the number on the die is 20), or if the result of your attack exceeds the target’s AC by 10, this is called a critical success (also known as a critical hit).


        If you critically succeed at a Strike, your attack deals double damage (see page 293). This damage doubling applies only on Strikes. Other attacks, such as spells or some uses of the Athletics skill, describe the specific effects that occur when their outcomes are critical successes.

        If you attack with something that wasn’t built to be a weapon, such as a chair or a vase, you’re making an attack with an improvised weapon. Treat it as a simple weapon of poor quality (regardless of its actual quality). The GM determines the amount and type of damage the attack deals, if any, as well as any weapon traits the improvised weapon should have. Many improvised weapons have the nonlethal trait.

        Characters who focus on combat need to carefully consider their choice of weapons, evaluating whether they want to fight in melee or at range, damage potential, and the special features of various weapons. Characters who are primarily spellcasters usually just need to pick a backup weapon in the best category they’re proficient with.

        When selecting weapons, you should start by identifying the weapon types that you have proficiency in. You should then compare weapons within these types to determine which ones you will have the highest melee or ranged attack modifier with. It’s usually considered best practice to select both a melee and ranged weapon during character creation so you can contend with a broader variety of foes.

        Ranged and thrown weapons have a range increment, indicated here in feet. Attacks with the weapon work normally up to that distance. Attacks beyond the weapon’s range increment take a –2 penalty for each additional multiple beyond. For example, a shortbow takes no penalty against a target up to 60 feet away, a –2 penalty against a target beyond 60 feet but up to 120 feet away, and a –4 penalty against a target beyond 120 feet but up to 180 feet away, and so on. Attacks that would take a penalty greater than –10 due to range are impossible.

        Ranged weapons indicate how many Interact actions it takes to reload them. This can be 0 if drawing ammunition and firing the weapon are part of the same action. If an item takes 2 or more actions to reload, the GM determines whether you can spend those actions out of sequence or if they must be performed together as an activity.


        An item with an entry of “—” must be drawn to be thrown, which usually takes an Interact action just like drawing any other weapon. Reloading and drawing a thrown weapon both require a free hand. When you spend the last action required to reload a weapon you’re holding, as part of that action, you can place your hands in the grip necessary to wield the weapon normally.

        Some weapons require one hand to use, and others require two. A few items, such as a bow, list 1+ for its hands entry. You can hold such a weapon in one hand, but the process of shooting it requires using another hand to retrieve, prepare, and shoot a piece of ammunition. This means you can do other things with your other hand while holding the bow in one hand without spending an action to change your grip, but you must free up your other hand in order to shoot. For example, you could shoot an arrow with your first action, use an Interact action to open a door with your second action, then shoot another arrow ^with your third action. You’re considered to be wielding a 1+ weapon as long as you’re holding it in one hand and also have a hand free.


        Weapons that require two hands typically deal more damage. Some weapons that use one hand have the two-hand trait, causing them to deal a different weapon damage die when used in two hands.


        In addition, some abilities require you to be wielding a weapon in two hands. You meet this requirement as long as you hold the weapon in two hands, even if it doesn’t actually require two hands or have the two-hand trait.

        An attached weapon must be combined with another piece of gear in order to be used. The trait lists what type of item the weapon must be attached to. You must be wielding or wearing the item the weapon is attached to in order to attack with it. For example, shield spikes are attached to a shield, allowing you to attack with the spikes instead of a shield bash, but only if you’re wielding the shield. An attached weapon is usually bolted onto or built into the item it’s attached to, and typically an item can have only one weapon attached to it. An attached weapon can be removed from one item and attached to another with successful use of the Crafting skill. If an item is destroyed, its attached weapon can usually be salvaged.

        Certain ancestry feats, class features, feats, weapon runes, and other abilities can grant you additional benefits when you achieve a critical success on an attack roll with certain weapons. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon. If an effect requires a saving throw or check, use your class DC.

        Choose one creature adjacent to the initial target and within reach. If its AC is lower than your attack roll for the critical hit, you deal damage to that creature equal to a roll of your weapon’s damage die (including extra dice for its potency rune, if any). No bonuses or other additional dice apply to this damage.

        If the target of the critical hit is adjacent to a surface, it gets stuck to that surface by the missile. The target is immobile and must spend an Interact action to attempt a DC 10 Athletics check to pull the missile free before it can move from its space. The creature doesn’t become stuck if it’s incorporeal, liquid (like a water elemental or some oozes), or could otherwise escape without effort.

        These four-pronged metal spikes can cause damage to a creature’s feet. You can scatter caltrops in an empty square adjacent to you with an Interact action. The first creature that moves into that square must succeed at a DC 14 Acrobatics check or take 1d4 piercing damage and 1 persistent bleed damage. A creature taking bleed damage from caltrops is hampered 5. Spending an Interact action to pluck the caltrops free reduces the DC to stop the bleeding. Once a creature takes damage from caltrops, enough caltrops are ruined that other creatures moving into the square are safe.


        Deployed caltrops can be salvaged to be used again if no creatures took damage from them. Otherwise, enough caltrops are ruined that they can’t be salvaged.

        This satchel includes 50 feet of hemp rope, some pulleys, a dozen pitons, a hammer, a grappling hook, and one set of crampons.

        Binding a creature in manacles requires one successful touch attack to bind each wrist or ankle. A creature is normally untrained with manacle touch attacks. A two- legged creature with its legs bound is hampered 15, and a two-handed creature with its wrists bound has to succeed at a DC 5 flat check any time it uses a manipulate action or else that action fails. A creature bound to a stationary object is immobile. For creatures with more or fewer limbs, the GM determines what effect manacles have, if any. Freeing a creature from manacles requires three successful DC 22 Thievery checks to Pick the Lock. Expert-quality manacles require four successes at DC 27, and master- quality manacles require five successes at DC 32.

If carried, the Bulk increases to 2.

A hoe, shovel, or sledgehammer is a long tool, and a hand drill, ice hook, or trowel is a short tool. A tool can usually be used as an improvised weapon, dealing 1d4 damage for a short tool or 1d6 for a long tool. The GM determines the damage type that’s appropriate or adjusts the damage if needed.

        The armor, weapons, and gear listed in this chapter are considered to be of standard quality unless otherwise noted, created by a crafter who is trained in the appropriate skill. Standard items do not impose a bonus or penalty on any attacks or checks using the item. You might encounter items of poor quality from time to time, and as you adventure you may find, craft, or purchase items crafted at a significantly higher quality.

        Improvised or of dubious make, poor-quality items are never available for purchase except for in the most desperate of communities, usually for half the Price of a standard item, though you can never sell them in any case. Attacks and checks using a poor-quality item take a –2 item penalty. This penalty also applies to the DCs of all checks that a poor-quality item applies to (such as AC with poor- quality armor). A poor-quality suit of armor also worsens the armor’s check penalty by 2. If a poor-quality item takes enough damage to gain a Dent, it is broken instead.

        Weapons and skill-boosting items of expert, master, and legendary quality add the listed item bonus to attack rolls with the weapon or skill checks using the item (see Table 6–19). Higher-quality armor reduces its check penalty by an amount equal to the item bonus (so master-quality hide would have a –1 check penalty instead of the standard –3 check penalty). As with other item bonuses, you apply only the higher item bonus from the item’s quality or its magic.

        Weapons that shoot ammunition convey their bonuses and abilities onto their ammunition, so an attack roll using standard-quality ammunition and an expert-quality bow still gains a +1 item bonus. You can also purchase high- quality ammunition—10 pieces of ammunition cost as much as a single weapon. Magic ammunition has special benefits, but attacking with high-quality nonmagical ammunition doesn’t confer any special bonus or benefit, so using expert-quality ammunition with a standard bow does not provide any bonus to the attack roll.

Those that offer a benefit for improved quality list their Price and bonuses in their description. A finely crafted jeweled lantern, for example, is no better at providing light than an ordinary lantern, even if it is worth 100 sp.

        You can use the Craft downtime activity (see page 148) to improve the quality of an item up to your proficiency rank in the Crafting skill. For this purpose, the Price equals the difference in Price between the two qualities. Upgrading an expert-quality chain shirt to master quality, for example, uses a Price of 3,250 sp. This requires you to have master Crafting and to provide 1,625 sp worth of raw materials to start the process.


        Nonmagical items might decrease in quality over a long period of neglect or after extended use, but they can be restored in the same way as improving an item.

        Weapons and armor must be expert quality or better to be made into a magic item. Quality determines the maximum bonus and number of properties the weapon or armor can have. The full rules for magic items begin on page 376.


        Magic items are always assumed to be the minimum level of quality for their bonus unless noted otherwise, and the quality cost is included in the item’s Price. Rarely, an item will be of a higher quality than the bonus would indicate, with its Price increased by the difference in quality. A +1 legendary longsword, for example, would cost 64,650 sp more than an ordinary +1 longsword (which would normally be crafted at an expert level).

        The Bulk rules in this chapter are made for Small and Medium creatures, and similarly the items are sized for creatures of those sizes. Large or larger creatures can carry more, and Tiny creatures can carry less. Their Bulk limits are multiplied, as noted on the table below.


        In most cases, the only creatures of sizes other than Small or Medium are monsters under the GM control, in which case you probably won’t need to track Bulk carefully. These rules for Bulk limits mainly come up when a group tries to load up a mount or animal companion, and the rules for items of different sizes apply when the characters defeat a big creature that has gear, like a fire giant.

        Creatures of different sizes count items of lower or higher Bulk in a similar way to how Small and Medium creatures count light items, as shown in the table. For example, a Large creature counts 10 items of 1 Bulk as 1 Bulk and a Huge creature counts 10 items of 2 Bulk as 1 Bulk. A Tiny creature counts 10 items of negligible Bulk as 1 Bulk. Negligible items work in a similar way—a Huge creature can carry any number of 1-Bulk items. A Tiny creature doesn’t count any items as negligible Bulk.

        Creatures of sizes other than Small or Medium need items appropriate to their size. These items have different Bulk, and possibly a different Price. The table below provides the differences. Items that are always built for creatures of a certain size (such as the barding on page 189) already include any necessary adjustments.


        For example, a morningstar has a Price of 10 sp and 1 Bulk, so one made for a Huge creature has a Price of 40 sp and 4 Bulk. One made for a Tiny creature still costs 10 sp (due to its intricacy) and has 1/2 Bulk, which converts to light Bulk. A torch costs 1 cp and has light Bulk, so a torch made for a Huge creature costs 4 cp and has 2 Bulk, and one made for a Tiny creature costs 1 cp and has negligible Bulk.


        A Tiny creature or one that’s Large or larger counts items of different Bulk in a special way, as described on above. This means these creatures can usually wear and carry about the same amount of gear as a Medium creature if the equipment is appropriately sized.


        The Price adjustment applies only to the Price of the item itself. Prices for magic items and alchemical items mostly come from their magic or alchemical properties. The Price of an item made from special materials is calculated based on the item’s Bulk, after adjusting the Bulk for the item’s size. See Chapter 11 for more  information.
