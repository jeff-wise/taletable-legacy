        Some abilities require a degree of training but can be learned by anyone, not only members of certain ancestries or classes. These abilities are called general feats. For most classes, you gain a general feat when you reach 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter. You can select any feat whose prerequisites you satisfy. General feats also include skill feats, which expand on what you can accomplish via skills. Most characters gain skill feats at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter; see your class for details.

        You can spend the day Gathering Information specifically about deals on items rather than other information. Name an item or a general category of items (such as “magic weapons”) you’re looking for and then roll your Diplomacy check. Any bonuses you have when Gathering Information apply. The GM sets the DC based on the population of the settlement, the difficulty of finding the easiest-to-find item, how many merchants are in the area, and similar factors. If you choose not to buy the item using a deal right away, the GM determines whether the deal is still good later on. This type of Gather Information action has special outcomes on a success or critical success.


        You can also use the Practice a Trade activity with Diplomacy instead of the Lore skill, spending your days hunting bargains and reselling at a profit.

        You can patch up yourself or an adjacent ally, even if you’re in the middle of combat. In order to do so, you must attempt a DC 20 Medicine check. Regardless of your result, the target is bolstered to your use of Battle Medic.


        If you’re a master of Medicine, you can instead attempt a DC 25 check to increase the Hit Points regained by 2d10, and if you’re legendary, you can instead attempt a DC 30 check to increase the Hit Points regained by 4d10.

        You can spend 7 days of downtime with a normal animal (not a companion, familiar, or other special animal) attempting to bond with it. At the end of the 7 days, attempt a DC 20 Nature check: if you succeed, you form a bond with the animal. Bonding with a new animal ends any previous bond you had. You can’t have both a bonded animal and an animal companion (or have a bonded animal that is also an animal companion).


        During combat, you can give an orders to your bonded animal more easily. You can use the Command an Animal action as a free action triggered after your first Handle an Animal action of the round.

        When you get a critical success with the Lie action, the target’s attitude toward you improves by one step, as though you’d succeeded at using Diplomacy to Make an Impression. This works only once per conversation, and if you get critical successes against multiple targets using the same result, you choose which creature’s attitude to improve. You must be lying in a way that appears to impart important information­—in other words, your lie must make the target grateful for your supposed help, which trivial or irrelevant lies can’t achieve.

        You have a system that lets you search at great speed, finding details and secrets twice as quickly as others can. When searching, you take half as long as usual to search a given area. This also allows you to move twice as quickly while exploring and ensure you’ve searched an area before walking into it. If you’re legendary in Perception, you instead search areas four times as quickly.

        You often smuggle things past the authorities. When the GM rolls your Stealth check to see if a passive observer notices a small item you have concealed, she uses the number rolled or 10, whichever is higher. If you’re a master in Stealth, she uses the number rolled or 15, and if you’re legendary in Stealth, you automatically succeed at hiding a small concealed item from a passive observer. This provides no benefits when a creature attempts a Perception check while actively searching you for hidden items. Due to your skill at smuggling, you are more likely to find more lucrative smuggling tasks when using Underworld Lore to Practice a Trade.

        Tracking is second nature to you, and when necessary you can follow a trail without pause. You can Track while moving at full Speed by taking a –5 penalty to your Survival check. If you’re a master in Survival, you don’t take the –5 penalty. If you’re legendary in Survival, you no longer need to roll a new Survival check every hour when tracking, though you still need to roll whenever there are significant changes in the trail.

        When you use the Perform action, compare your check result to the Will DC of one observer. If you succeed, the target is fascinated with you for 1 round; if the observer is in a situation that demands immediate attention, such as combat, you must critically succeed to fascinate the target. You must choose which creature you’re attempting to fascinate before you roll your check, and regardless of your result, the target is bolstered against your Fascinating Performance. If you’re an expert in Performance, you can compare your check result to the Will DCs of up to four observers and fascinate any number of them. If you’re a master in Performance you can fascinate up to 10 observers with a single check, and if you’re legendary in Performance you can try to fascinate any number of observers at the same time.

        Your body bounces back from extreme situations much more quickly than most. You recover twice as many Hit Points from resting. Each time you succeed at a Fortitude save against an ongoing toxin, you reduce its stage by 2, or by 1 against a virulent toxin. Each critical success you achieve against an ongoing toxin reduces its stage by 3, or by 2 against a virulent toxin. In addition, you reduce the severity of your drained condition by 2 when you rest for a night instead of by 1. You reduce your enervated condition by 2 when you succeed at your Fortitude save or spend a day of downtime training, and by 3 when you critically succeed at your Fortitude save. For more information on these conditions, see page 321.

        While Surviving in the Wilderness during downtime, you can always find enough food and water to provide yourself a subsistence living (provided you aren’t in an area that’s completely lacking in appropriate resources). If you are trained but not better, finding food and water for another or providing a comfortable living still requires you to attempt Survival checks and hope for a critical success; on any other successful result, you still find only enough for your own subsistence.


        If you’re an expert, even without rolling you can always find enough food and water for your own comfortable living or subsistence living for yourself and one other creature that eats roughly as much as a human, and on a critical success you find enough for a second additional creature.


        If you’re a master, you can always find enough for comfortable living for yourself and one other or subsistence living for yourself and two others without rolling, and you can provide for twice as many others on a critical success.


        If you’re legendary, you can always find enough for comfortable living for yourself and four others or subsistence living for yourself and eight others without rolling, but a critical success provides no additional benefit.


        Multiple smaller creatures or creatures with significantly smaller appetites than a human are counted as a single creature for this feat, and larger creatures or those with significantly greater appetite each count as multiple creatures. The GM determines how much a particular non-human creature needs to eat.

        First impressions are your strong suit. When you meet someone, you can immediately attempt a Diplomacy check to Make an Impression with a –5 penalty rather than needing to converse for 1 minute. On a success, you don’t gain any further benefit for spending 1 minute in conversation, but if you fail or critically fail, you can engage in 1 minute of conversation and attempt a new check at the end of that time rather than accepting the failure or critical failure result. This functions only when you meet someone in a social situation, not if you encounter them in a hostile situation such as a combat encounter.

        You are a genius at Crafting, easily able to determine how things are made and create new inventions. You can spend downtime to invent a common formula that you don’t know. This works just like the Craft skill: you spend a number of days in preparation and half the Price of the formula up front, roll a Crafting check, and on a success either finish the formula by paying the difference or work for longer to decrease the Price. The difference is that you spend the additional time in research, design, and development, rather than in creating an item.

If you slow down and spend the full amount of time that’s ordinarily required, treat a success as a critical success; if you critically succeed while spending the normal amount of time, you gain a nearly word-for-word understanding of the document.

        Your ability to steal items defies belief. You can attempt to Steal an Object that is actively wielded or that would be extremely noticeable or time-consuming to remove (like worn shoes or armor). You must do so slowly and carefully, spending at least 1 minute and significantly longer for items that are normally time-consuming to remove (like armor). Throughout this duration you must have some means of staying hidden, whether under cover of darkness or in a bustling crowd, for example. You take a –5 penalty on your Thievery check. Even if you succeed, if the item is extremely prominent, like a suit of full plate armor, onlookers will quickly notice it’s gone after you steal it.

        When you critically succeed using Deception to Create a Diversion, you continue to remain only sensed after the end of your turn. This effect lasts for an amount of time depending on the diversion and the situation, as determined by the GM (but for a minimum of 1 additional round).

        For instance, if Merisiel runs away after throwing a rock in the opposite direction to make noise and achieves a critical success on her Deception check, the guards might continue chasing in the direction of the rock until they either give up pursuit or notice consequences of Merisiel’s later actions.

        Learning new spells comes easily to you. Choose arcane, divine, occult, or primal; you can choose a magic tradition only if you are an expert in the associated skill. You take only 10 minutes per spell level to learn a spell of that type, rather than 1 hour per spell level. If you fail to learn a spell of that type, you can try to learn it again after 1 week or after you gain a level, whichever comes first. If you’re a master in the chosen type of magic’s associated skill, learning a spell takes only 5 minutes per spell level, and if you’re legendary in that skill, it takes only 1 minute per spell level.

        You can spend 10 minutes applying natural cures to heal a creature, after which you must attempt a DC 20 Nature check. On a success, the target regains Hit Points equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom modifier. If you’re a master of Nature, the target regains an additional 1d8 Hit Points. You can use this feat to heal a particular creature only once per day.


        If you’re in the wilderness, you might have easier access to fresh ingredients, allowing you to restore an additional 1d8 Hit Points on a success or critical success, subject to the GM’s determination.

For instance, you can forage for food even if the plane lacks food that could normally sustain you, and you could find your bearings on a plane that doesn’t have stars, a sun, or other normal aids to navigation. A success at Surviving in the Wild can reduce the plane’s damage as well, at the GM’s discretion.

        The GM rolls a secret Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion check, whichever corresponds to the tradition of the spell being cast. If you’re not trained in the skill, you can’t get a result better than failure. The DC of the check is 10 plus triple the level of the spell. The DC for an uncommon spell is usually 2 higher, and 5 higher for a rare spell.

        You can read the lips of others nearby who you can clearly see. When you’re at your leisure, you can do this automatically. In encounter mode or when attempting a more difficult feat of lip reading, you are fascinated and flat-footed during each round in which you focus on the lip movements, and you must succeed at a Society check (DC determined by the GM) to successfully read someone’s lips in such circumstances.


        If you are deaf or hard of hearing and have Read Lips, you recognize the lip movements for the spoken form of your languages. You can also speak the spoken form of your languages clearly enough for others to understand you, so long as you can produce sound vocally.

Instead of attempting a Crafting check, you attempt a check with the appropriate skill for the spell’s tradition—Arcana for a spell on the arcane spell list, Nature for a primal spell, Occultism for an occult spell, and Religion for a divine spell. If a spell appears on multiple spell lists, you can choose which of the applicable skills to use.


        You must have access to a spell in order to scribe it onto a scroll.

        Your training focused on Crafting one particular kind of item. Select one of the specialties listed below; you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Crafting checks to Craft items of that type. If it’s unclear whether the specialty applies, the GM decides. Some specialties might only partially apply. For example, if you were making a morningstar and had specialty in woodworking, the GM might give you half your bonus because the item requires both blacksmithing and woodworking.

        If you use Palm an Object or Steal an Object on a scroll, spellbook, or similar item, you can remove the magical writing without disturbing the parchment or other surface it was inscribed upon. When you do, you must have a blank scroll or page in your possession that you can transfer the magical writing onto, or else the magic is expended and lost. The GM usually applies a penalty to observers’ Perception checks and DCs to notice the theft, unless the writing is on open display (in the case of an unfurled scroll, for example). You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check because you don’t need to collect the entire object. However, higher-level magic is harder to steal, so the DC is increased by the spell’s level.

        You can keep your balance easily, even when balancing in adverse conditions. You treat a success using the Balance action as a critical success. You’re not flat-footed while attempting to Balance on narrow surfaces and uneven ground, and if you’re the target of an attack or effect that requires a saving throw, you fall only if you critically fail your attempt to Maintain Balance.

If you’re expert, master, or legendary in Nature, you might be able to train more exotic creatures, at the GM’s discretion.

        You examine a magic item you would normally not be able to use—for example, a fighter normally couldn’t use a scroll, staff, or wand—in an effort to fool the item and activate it temporarily. Attempt a check with a skill DC of the item’s level (typically the low-difficulty DC, but the GM could adjust this at their discretion), using the skill that matches the item’s magic tradition (Arcana for a spell on the arcane spell list, Nature for a primal spell, Occultism for an occult spell, and Religion for a divine spell). You must have identified the magic item (or had it identified for you) in order to activate it this way. If you activate a magic item that requires your spell roll or spell DC and you don’t have the ability to cast spells of the relevant type (such as arcane or divine), you have the untrained proficiency rank and can use the highest of your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma modifiers. If you’re a master in the appropriate skill for that magical tradition, you’re treated as having the trained proficiency rank instead. If the spell’s tradition depends on the caster’s class or requires her to have the spell on her spell list, you choose which class you’re attempting to emulate.

        You can read and understand magic writing as long as it is in a language you can normally read. This usually takes about 1 minute per page of text, but it could take longer in the case of ancient or obscure writings, or in other situations at the GM’s discretion. To read and understand the nuances of particularly archaic, esoteric, or obscure texts, the GM may require you to attempt an Arcana check to see if you understand the true meaning of the magic writing. The GM might have you attempt one check for the entire text or one check for each section of a larger text.

        If you end your turn in the water and haven’t succeeded at a Swim action that turn, you sink down 10 feet or float up 10 feet, as determined by the GM. However, if your last action on your turn was to enter the water, you don’t sink or float that turn.

        You can make an item from raw materials. The GM determines the DC to Craft an item, which is based on its level, quality, and rarity, and might be affected by other circumstances. You need the Alchemical Crafting skill feat (page 162) to create alchemical items, the Magical Crafting skill feat (page 168) to create magic items, and the Snare Crafting feat (page 171) to create snares.


        To Craft an item, you must meet the following requirements:
        •	 The item is your level or lower. (An item that doesn’t list a level is level 0.)
        •	 You have the proficiency rank appropriate to the item’s quality. (See page 190.)
        •	 You have the formula for the item.
        •	 You have an appropriate set of tools and, in many cases, a workshop. For example, you need access to a smithy to forge a metal shield.
        •	 You must supply raw materials worth at least half the item’s
        Price. You always expend at least that amount of raw materials when you Craft successfully. If you’re in a settlement, you can usually spend currency to get an equal amount of raw materials you need, except in the case of rarer special materials.


        You need to spend a minimum number of downtime days to Craft your item to a basic state of completion. This number depends on your level and the level of the item. You need to spend 4 downtime days for an item of your level. Reduce the number of days by 1 for each level by which your level exceeds the item’s level, to a minimum of 1 day. After spending this base number of days, you can either expend more materials to complete the item immediately or spend more days Crafting, completing the item more slowly but at lower cost. The success entry explains this mechanic further.


        You can Craft items with the consumable trait in batches, making up to four of the same item simultaneously. This requires you to include the raw materials for all the items in the batch at the start, and you must complete the batch all at once.


        After you expend the required amount of raw materials and base downtime, attempt a Crafting check. If you fail or critically fail, you can try to Craft the item again, but you have to start over.

        Your attempt to create the item is successful. You can pay the remaining half of the item’s Price to complete it immediately, or spend additional downtime days working on it. For each additional day you spend, reduce the value of the materials you need to expend to complete the item by an amount based on your level and proficiency rank (see Table 4–3). After any of these downtime days, you can complete the item by spending the remaining amount. If your downtime days are interrupted, you can return to finish the item later, continuing right where you left off.

        You create a disguise to pass yourself off as someone or something you are not. Putting together a decent disguise takes 10 minutes and requires a disguise kit (see page 184), but a simpler, quicker disguise might do the job if you’re not trying to imitate a specific individual, at the GM’s discretion.


        In most cases, creatures have a chance to detect you only if they use the Seek action to roll Perception checks against your Deception DC. If you attempt to directly interact with someone while disguised, you need to roll a secret Deception check against that creature’s Perception DC instead. If you’re disguised as a specific individual, the GM might give creatures you interact with a bonus based on how well they know the person you’re imitating, or ask you to roll a secret Deception check even if you aren’t directly interacting with them.

        You try to fool someone with an untruth. Doing so takes at least 1 round, or longer if the lie is elaborate. You roll a single Deception check and compare it against the Perception DC of every creature you are trying to fool. The GM may modify this DC based on the situation and the nature of the lie you are trying to tell. Elaborate or highly unbelievable lies are much harder to get a creature to believe than simpler and more believable lies, and some lies are so big it’s impossible to get anyone to believe them.


        At the GM’s discretion, if a creature initially believes your lie, it might still be able to attempt a Perception check against your Deception DC (success on the creature’s part gains the failure effect below) to realize it’s a lie. This usually happens if the creature discovers enough evidence to counter your statements.

        You have specialized information on a narrow topic. Lore is different than other skills in two ways.


        First, the lore skill features many subcategories. You might have Military Lore, Sailing Lore, Vampire Lore, or any similar subcategory of skill. Each subcategory counts as its own skill, so applying a skill increase to Planar Lore wouldn’t increase your modifier with Sailing Lore. You gain a subcategory of the Lore skill from your background. The GM determines what other subcategories she’ll allow as Lore skills, though these categories are always less broad than any of the other skills that allow you to Recall Knowledge, and they should never be able to fully take the place of another skill’s ability to Recall Knowledge. For instance, you couldn’t choose Magic Lore in an attempt to recall the same breadth of knowledge covered by Arcana or Adventuring Lore in an attempt to gain all the information an adventurer would need.


        Second, all of your Lore skills are signature skills (see page 144). This means that you can advance them to expert or legendary proficiency if you so choose.


        If you have multiple subcategories of Lore that could apply to a check, or that would overlap with another skill in the circumstances, you can choose to use the skill with the better skill modifier or that you would prefer to use. If there’s any doubt whether a Lore skill applies to a specific topic or use, the GM decides whether it can be used or not.


        You can perform the following action using any category of Lore, even if you are untrained in any Lore skill or a certain category of Lore.

        You apply the practical benefits of your Lore specialty to earn money during periods of downtime. Practicing a Trade is most effective with Lore specialties such as business, law, or sailing, where there’s demand for workers. The GM might increase the DC if you’re attempting to use an obscure Lore skill to practice a trade.


        The GM assigns a task level representing the difficulty of the most lucrative job available. You can go looking for lower-level tasks, with the GM determining whether you find any. Sometimes you can attempt to find better work than the initial offerings, though this requires spending downtime to Gather Information or researching and socializing.


        When you take on a job, the GM sets the DC of your Lore check. The amount of money you can earn depends on the task level and your proficiency rank, as listed on Table 4–4: Skill Income. You might also need specialized tools to accept a job, like mining tools to work in a mine or a merchant’s scale to buy and sell valuables in a market.


        You need to spend a minimum number of downtime days to locate and secure the job, prepare to practice your trade, and get started on the task. This number depends on your level and the level of the task. You must spend 4 downtime days for a task of your level. Reduce the number of days by 1 for each level lower than you the task is, to a minimum of 1 day. Conversely, increase the number of days by 1 for each level higher than you the task is. After this base downtime, you earn your initial amount of money, and you can continue at the task to keep earning more. The success entry explains how this works. Note that if you want to earn money for working just 1 day, you need to pick a task that requires only 1 day of preparation. A 0-level task always requires 1 day.


        After you spend the base downtime to get started, roll your Lore check to determine your earnings. You continue to earn that amount each day for the duration of the job, without requiring further checks. The GM determines how long the job lasts, which is limited by how long the task will take to complete and other factors. Most tasks last a week or two, though some can take months or even years. If you stop in the middle of a task, normally you have to find a new task when you return, but the GM might decide that you can pick up where you left off (which usually happens only if the job is incomplete and the setup you did is still applicable).

If an animal knows an activity, such as a horse’s Gallop, you can command the animal to perform the activity, but you must spend as many Command an Animal actions as the activity’s number of actions. The animal uses the action you command.


        Most animals understand only the simplest instructions, so you might be able to instruct your animal to move to a certain square but not dictate a specific path to get there, or command it to attack a certain creature but not to make its attack nonlethal.

        Once you discover that an item, ongoing effect, or location is magical, you can spend an hour to attempt to identify the nature and particulars of its magic. If your attempt is interrupted in any way, you must start over. The GM sets the DC for your check (see Table 4–2 on page 146). Cursed or particularly esoteric items usually have higher DCs or might even be impossible to identify using Nature alone. Heightening a spell doesn’t increase the DC.

        •	 Spend 1 hour per level of the spell, during which you must remain in conversation with the person who knows the spell or have the magical writing in your possession.
        •	 Have an amount of magical materials with a value indicated in Table 4–2 on page 146.

        You can read and understand occult writing, including complex metaphysical systems, syncretic principles, and incoherent ramblings, as long as it is in a language you can normally read. This usually takes about 1 minute per page of text. To read and understand the nuances of particularly archaic, esoteric, or obscure texts, the GM may require you to attempt an Occultism check to see if you understand the true meaning of the esoterica. The GM might have you attempt one check for the entire text or one check for each section of a larger text.

        Your character starts out with 150 silver pieces (sp) to spend on any common items from this chapter. Items with an uncommon rarity can only be bought with special access or GM permission. If you’re playing a spellcaster and want to buy magic items (like potions, scrolls, or holy water) or an alchemist and want to buy alchemical items, your GM can give you permission to buy those, and she will tell you which items you can choose from and how much they cost.


        Once you’ve purchased your starting items, there are three main ways to gain new items and equipment: you can find them during an adventure, make them with the Crafting skill, or purchase them from a merchant.

        Though you might be able to barter valuable items in some areas, currency is the most versatile way to make transactions when you head to market. The most common currency is coin. For most commoners and beginning adventurers, the standard unit is the silver piece (sp). Each silver piece is of a standard weight of silver and is typically accepted by any merchant or kingdom no matter where it was minted. There are three other types of common coins, each likewise standardized in weight and value. The first is the copper piece (cp). Each copper piece is worth one-tenth of a silver piece. The gold piece (gp) is often used for purchasing magic items and other expensive items, as 1 gold piece is worth 10 silver pieces or 100 copper pieces. The platinum piece (pp) is used by nobles to demonstrate their wealth, for the purchase of very expensive items, or simply as a way to easily transport large sums of currency. A platinum piece is worth 10 gold pieces, 100 silver pieces, or 1,000 copper pieces. See Table 6–1: Coin Values for the exchange rates of common types of coins.

        Coins are popular due to their portability. A thousand coins of any denomination or combination of denominations count as 1 Bulk (see below). It’s not usually necessary to determine the Bulk of coins in fractions of 1,000. In other words, 100 coins don’t count as a light item, and 1,999 coins count as 1 Bulk, not 2.

        Most items in the following tables have a Price, which is the amount of currency it typically takes to purchase that item. However, some of the items listed have an inherent or otherwise meaningless cost, indicated with “—”. This typically indicates that an entry can’t be purchased. An item with a “0” Price indicates that it is normally free, but its value could be higher based on its quality or the composition of its materials. Most items can be sold for half their Price, but coins and raw materials (such as crafting components) can be exchanged for their full Price.

        Each item has an item level, which represents the complexity of the item and any magic used in its construction. Simpler items with a lower level are easier to construct, and you can’t Craft items that have a higher level than your own (see page 148). If an item’s level isn’t listed, its level is 0. While characters can use items of any level, Game Masters should keep in mind that allowing characters access to items far above their current level may imbalance the game.

        A character typically has two hands, allowing her to hold an item in each hand or a single two-handed item using both hands. Drawing or changing how you’re carrying an item usually requires an Interact action (dropping items instead uses the Drop action). Table 6–2: Changing Equipment lists some ways that you might change the items you’re holding or carrying, and the number of hands you need to do so. Many ways to use items cost multiple actions. For example, drinking a potion stowed in your belt pouch requires drawing it with an Interact action and drinking it with an Operate Activation action.

        Especially heavy or unwieldy items can make it more difficult for you to move swiftly, as can overloading yourself with too much gear. The Bulk value of an item reflects how difficult an item is to handle, representing both weight and the size of the item. In most cases, you don’t need to worry about Bulk unless you’re carrying numerous substantial items or you have a low Strength score.

        Items may have a number to indicate their Bulk value, or may be light (indicated by an L) or negligible for the purpose of determining Bulk (indicated by a —). For instance, full plate armor is 4 Bulk, a longsword is 1 Bulk, a dagger or scroll is light, and a piece of chalk is negligible. Ten light items count as 1 Bulk, and you don’t count fractions (so 9 light items count as 0, and 11 items count as 1). Items of negligible Bulk don’t count toward Bulk unless you try to carry vast numbers of them, as determined by the GM.

        As a general rule, an item that weighs 5 to 10 pounds is 1 Bulk, an item weighing less than a few ounces is negligible, and anything in between is light. Particularly awkward or unwieldy items might have different Bulk values. A 10-foot pole isn’t heavy, but its length makes it difficult for you to move while you have one on your person. Items made for larger or smaller creatures have greater or lesser Bulk, as described on page 191.

        An item can be destroyed if it takes damage enough times. An item reduces any damage dealt to it by its Hardness. The Hardness of various materials is explained in the Materials section on page 354. If an item takes damage equal to or exceeding the item’s Hardness, the item takes a Dent. If the item takes damage equal to or greater than twice its Hardness in one hit, it takes 2 Dents. For instance, a wooden shield (Hardness 3) that takes 10 damage would take 2 Dents. A typical item can take only 1 Dent without becoming broken. A second Dent causes it to become broken, though it can still be repaired. An item that would take a Dent or become broken while already broken is destroyed beyond salvage. Some magical or especially sturdy items can take more than 1 Dent before becoming broken, as noted in their descriptions.

        Broken is a condition that affects objects. A broken object can’t be used for its normal function, nor does it grant bonuses. It still imposes all penalties normally incurred by carrying, holding, or wearing it. For example, a suit of armor would still impose its Dexterity modifier cap, check penalty, and so forth. Broken armor is an exception. It still grants its item bonuses, but also gives you a conditional penalty to AC depending on its category: –1 for broken light armor, –2 for broken medium armor, or –3 for broken heavy armor.

        Your Armor Class (AC) measures how well you can defend against attacks. Your Touch Armor Class (TAC) protects against attacks that need only to touch you. Your Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity modifier (up to your armor’s Dexterity modifier cap) plus your proficiency modifier for any armor or shield you are using plus the armor’s item bonus to AC. If you’re using both armor and a shield, apply the lower of the two proficiency modifiers. If you’re not wearing armor, substitute your proficiency in unarmored defense. Your Touch Armor Class uses the same calculation, except you add your armor’s item bonus to TAC instead of its bonus to AC. Some spells, magic item, and abilities give your character a bonus or penalty to AC. These also apply to TAC unless stated otherwise. - type: variable_text

        A shield requires the use of one of your hands. It grants its bonuses to AC and TAC only if you use an action to Raise a Shield. This grants the shield’s bonuses to AC and TAC as a circumstance bonus until your next turn starts. The shield’s check penalty applies whenever you’re wielding the shield, regardless of whether the shield is raised.


        While you have a shield raised, you can use the Shield Block reaction to reduce damage you take by the shield’s Hardness (3 for wooden shields or 5 for steel).

        If you want to reliably use your shield to attack, you need to buy and attach a shield boss or shield spikes to the shield. These work like other weapons, and can even be etched with runes (see page 370).

        Most characters in Pathfinder likely carry some kind of weapon, whether a keen-edged dagger, a mighty warhammer, a graceful bow, or even a simple club. Full details on how you calculate your bonuses, penalties, and modifiers for attack rolls and damage rolls are given in Chapter 1 on page 17, but they are summarized here.

        When making an attack, determine the result of your attack roll by rolling a d20 and adding your attack modifier with the weapon or unarmed attack you’re using. Your melee attack modifier is the sum of your proficiency modifier with a weapon plus your Strength modifier (or optionally, your Dexterity modifier for weapons with the finesse trait). Your ranged attack modifier is the sum of your proficiency modifier with a weapon plus your Dexterity modifier. Bonuses and penalties apply to these rolls just like with other types of checks. Magic weapons and weapons of expert quality or better add an item bonus to your attack rolls.

        If you attack more than once on the same turn, your attacks after the first take a penalty called a multiple attack penalty. Your second attack takes a –5 penalty, and any subsequent attacks take a –10 penalty. This penalty is untyped and is cumulative with all other penalties. The penalty doesn’t apply to attacks you take when it isn’t your turn (such as attacks made as part of a reaction), though these attacks often have their own penalty. You can choose a weapon with the agile trait to reduce your multiple attack penalty (see page 182).

        You can Strike with your fist or another body part, calculating your attack and damage rolls in the same way you would with a weapon. This counts as a simple weapon, so almost all characters start out trained in unarmed attacks. Use the statistics for a fist even if you’re kicking, kneeing, or attacking with another part of your body. Some ancestry feats, class features, class feats, and spells give access to special, more powerful unarmed attacks.

        When the result of your attack roll with a weapon or unarmed attack is equal to or exceeds your target’s AC, roll the weapon or unarmed attack’s damage die to determine the damage you deal. If you’re making a melee attack, you add your Strength modifier to the damage. Ranged weapons usually use only the weapon’s damage die, though weapons with the propulsive trait sometimes add half your Strength modifier, and thrown weapons add your full Strength modifier.


        Magic weapons add one or more weapon damage dice to your damage roll. These extra dice are the same die size as the weapon’s damage die.

        When you make an attack and roll a natural 20 (the number on the die is 20), or if the result of your attack exceeds the target’s AC by 10, this is called a critical success (also known as a critical hit).


        If you critically succeed at a Strike, your attack deals double damage (see page 293). This damage doubling applies only on Strikes. Other attacks, such as spells or some uses of the Athletics skill, describe the specific effects that occur when their outcomes are critical successes.

        If you attack with something that wasn’t built to be a weapon, such as a chair or a vase, you’re making an attack with an improvised weapon. Treat it as a simple weapon of poor quality (regardless of its actual quality). The GM determines the amount and type of damage the attack deals, if any, as well as any weapon traits the improvised weapon should have. Many improvised weapons have the nonlethal trait.

        Characters who focus on combat need to carefully consider their choice of weapons, evaluating whether they want to fight in melee or at range, damage potential, and the special features of various weapons. Characters who are primarily spellcasters usually just need to pick a backup weapon in the best category they’re proficient with.

        When selecting weapons, you should start by identifying the weapon types that you have proficiency in. You should then compare weapons within these types to determine which ones you will have the highest melee or ranged attack modifier with. It’s usually considered best practice to select both a melee and ranged weapon during character creation so you can contend with a broader variety of foes.

        Ranged and thrown weapons have a range increment, indicated here in feet. Attacks with the weapon work normally up to that distance. Attacks beyond the weapon’s range increment take a –2 penalty for each additional multiple beyond. For example, a shortbow takes no penalty against a target up to 60 feet away, a –2 penalty against a target beyond 60 feet but up to 120 feet away, and a –4 penalty against a target beyond 120 feet but up to 180 feet away, and so on. Attacks that would take a penalty greater than –10 due to range are impossible.

        Ranged weapons indicate how many Interact actions it takes to reload them. This can be 0 if drawing ammunition and firing the weapon are part of the same action. If an item takes 2 or more actions to reload, the GM determines whether you can spend those actions out of sequence or if they must be performed together as an activity.


        An item with an entry of “—” must be drawn to be thrown, which usually takes an Interact action just like drawing any other weapon. Reloading and drawing a thrown weapon both require a free hand. When you spend the last action required to reload a weapon you’re holding, as part of that action, you can place your hands in the grip necessary to wield the weapon normally.

        Some weapons require one hand to use, and others require two. A few items, such as a bow, list 1+ for its hands entry. You can hold such a weapon in one hand, but the process of shooting it requires using another hand to retrieve, prepare, and shoot a piece of ammunition. This means you can do other things with your other hand while holding the bow in one hand without spending an action to change your grip, but you must free up your other hand in order to shoot. For example, you could shoot an arrow with your first action, use an Interact action to open a door with your second action, then shoot another arrow ^with your third action. You’re considered to be wielding a 1+ weapon as long as you’re holding it in one hand and also have a hand free.


        Weapons that require two hands typically deal more damage. Some weapons that use one hand have the two-hand trait, causing them to deal a different weapon damage die when used in two hands.


        In addition, some abilities require you to be wielding a weapon in two hands. You meet this requirement as long as you hold the weapon in two hands, even if it doesn’t actually require two hands or have the two-hand trait.

        An attached weapon must be combined with another piece of gear in order to be used. The trait lists what type of item the weapon must be attached to. You must be wielding or wearing the item the weapon is attached to in order to attack with it. For example, shield spikes are attached to a shield, allowing you to attack with the spikes instead of a shield bash, but only if you’re wielding the shield. An attached weapon is usually bolted onto or built into the item it’s attached to, and typically an item can have only one weapon attached to it. An attached weapon can be removed from one item and attached to another with successful use of the Crafting skill. If an item is destroyed, its attached weapon can usually be salvaged.

        These weapons are used as a pair, each complementing the other. When you are wielding two of the same weapon with this trait and attack with one of them, if you already attacked with the other weapon this turn, you add a circumstance bonus to the damage roll equal to the weapon’s number of damage dice. For instance, if you attacked with a twin weapon in your right hand with your first action, you would gain this bonus to damage when you attack with a matching twin weapon in your left hand for your second action. On your third action, an attack with either weapon would receive this bonus, since you’d already attacked with both.

        These four-pronged metal spikes can cause damage to a creature’s feet. You can scatter caltrops in an empty square adjacent to you with an Interact action. The first creature that moves into that square must succeed at a DC 14 Acrobatics check or take 1d4 piercing damage and 1 persistent bleed damage. A creature taking bleed damage from caltrops is hampered 5. Spending an Interact action to pluck the caltrops free reduces the DC to stop the bleeding. Once a creature takes damage from caltrops, enough caltrops are ruined that other creatures moving into the square are safe.


        Deployed caltrops can be salvaged to be used again if no creatures took damage from them. Otherwise, enough caltrops are ruined that they can’t be salvaged.

        Binding a creature in manacles requires one successful touch attack to bind each wrist or ankle. A creature is normally untrained with manacle touch attacks. A two- legged creature with its legs bound is hampered 15, and a two-handed creature with its wrists bound has to succeed at a DC 5 flat check any time it uses a manipulate action or else that action fails. A creature bound to a stationary object is immobile. For creatures with more or fewer limbs, the GM determines what effect manacles have, if any. Freeing a creature from manacles requires three successful DC 22 Thievery checks to Pick the Lock. Expert-quality manacles require four successes at DC 27, and master- quality manacles require five successes at DC 32.

        Improvised or of dubious make, poor-quality items are never available for purchase except for in the most desperate of communities, usually for half the Price of a standard item, though you can never sell them in any case. Attacks and checks using a poor-quality item take a –2 item penalty. This penalty also applies to the DCs of all checks that a poor-quality item applies to (such as AC with poor- quality armor). A poor-quality suit of armor also worsens the armor’s check penalty by 2. If a poor-quality item takes enough damage to gain a Dent, it is broken instead.

        Expert, master, and legendary items are of a superior quality and can be crafted only by characters with the respective proficiency rank in the Crafting skill. Expert- quality armor and weapons are 2nd-level items, except expert heavy armor, which is 3rd level. Master-quality armor and weapons are 7th-level items, and legendary- quality armor and weapons are 15th-level items.

        Weapons and skill-boosting items of expert, master, and legendary quality add the listed item bonus to attack rolls with the weapon or skill checks using the item (see Table 6–19). Higher-quality armor reduces its check penalty by an amount equal to the item bonus (so master-quality hide would have a –1 check penalty instead of the standard –3 check penalty). As with other item bonuses, you apply only the higher item bonus from the item’s quality or its magic.

        Weapons that shoot ammunition convey their bonuses and abilities onto their ammunition, so an attack roll using standard-quality ammunition and an expert-quality bow still gains a +1 item bonus. You can also purchase high- quality ammunition—10 pieces of ammunition cost as much as a single weapon. Magic ammunition has special benefits, but attacking with high-quality nonmagical ammunition doesn’t confer any special bonus or benefit, so using expert-quality ammunition with a standard bow does not provide any bonus to the attack roll.

        While most items can be purchased at a better quality level for an increased Price, few actually grant any benefit from this improvement. Those that offer a benefit for improved quality list their Price and bonuses in their description. A finely crafted jeweled lantern, for example, is no better at providing light than an ordinary lantern, even if it is worth 100 sp.

        You can use the Craft downtime activity (see page 148) to improve the quality of an item up to your proficiency rank in the Crafting skill. For this purpose, the Price equals the difference in Price between the two qualities. Upgrading an expert-quality chain shirt to master quality, for example, uses a Price of 3,250 sp. This requires you to have master Crafting and to provide 1,625 sp worth of raw materials to start the process.


        Nonmagical items might decrease in quality over a long period of neglect or after extended use, but they can be restored in the same way as improving an item.

        Weapons and armor must be expert quality or better to be made into a magic item. Quality determines the maximum bonus and number of properties the weapon or armor can have. The full rules for magic items begin on page 376.


        Magic items are always assumed to be the minimum level of quality for their bonus unless noted otherwise, and the quality cost is included in the item’s Price. Rarely, an item will be of a higher quality than the bonus would indicate, with its Price increased by the difference in quality. A +1 legendary longsword, for example, would cost 64,650 sp more than an ordinary +1 longsword (which would normally be crafted at an expert level).

Table 6–19 lists the increased Hardness of an item of higher quality compared to a standard item. Structures, such as walls and doors, gain twice as much Hardness for higher quality, as shown on the table.

        The Bulk rules in this chapter are made for Small and Medium creatures, and similarly the items are sized for creatures of those sizes. Large or larger creatures can carry more, and Tiny creatures can carry less. Their Bulk limits are multiplied, as noted on the table below.


        In most cases, the only creatures of sizes other than Small or Medium are monsters under the GM control, in which case you probably won’t need to track Bulk carefully. These rules for Bulk limits mainly come up when a group tries to load up a mount or animal companion, and the rules for items of different sizes apply when the characters defeat a big creature that has gear, like a fire giant.

        Creatures of different sizes count items of lower or higher Bulk in a similar way to how Small and Medium creatures count light items, as shown in the table. For example, a Large creature counts 10 items of 1 Bulk as 1 Bulk and a Huge creature counts 10 items of 2 Bulk as 1 Bulk. A Tiny creature counts 10 items of negligible Bulk as 1 Bulk. Negligible items work in a similar way—a Huge creature can carry any number of 1-Bulk items. A Tiny creature doesn’t count any items as negligible Bulk.

        Creatures of sizes other than Small or Medium need items appropriate to their size. These items have different Bulk, and possibly a different Price. The table below provides the differences. Items that are always built for creatures of a certain size (such as the barding on page 189) already include any necessary adjustments.


        For example, a morningstar has a Price of 10 sp and 1 Bulk, so one made for a Huge creature has a Price of 40 sp and 4 Bulk. One made for a Tiny creature still costs 10 sp (due to its intricacy) and has 1/2 Bulk, which converts to light Bulk. A torch costs 1 cp and has light Bulk, so a torch made for a Huge creature costs 4 cp and has 2 Bulk, and one made for a Tiny creature costs 1 cp and has negligible Bulk.


        A Tiny creature or one that’s Large or larger counts items of different Bulk in a special way, as described on above. This means these creatures can usually wear and carry about the same amount of gear as a Medium creature if the equipment is appropriately sized.


        The Price adjustment applies only to the Price of the item itself. Prices for magic items and alchemical items mostly come from their magic or alchemical properties. The Price of an item made from special materials is calculated based on the item’s Bulk, after adjusting the Bulk for the item’s size. See Chapter 11 for more  information.
