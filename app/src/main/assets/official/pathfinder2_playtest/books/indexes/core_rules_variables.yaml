        The adventure begins now. In the following chapters we are going explore a world of magic
        filled with intriguing conflict. From village-sized dungeon crawls to reality-bending planar
        adventures, the words written in books and timeless tales passed down from generations will
        speak of a few protagonists, heroes with both the ability and the willpower to do things
        that others could not. Let's learn about how to create our heroes and the world they live in,
        including the races, creatuers, weapons, spells, and more.

        Your character starts out with 150 silver pieces (sp) to spend on any common items from this chapter. Items with an uncommon rarity can only be bought with special access or GM permission. If you’re playing a spellcaster and want to buy magic items (like potions, scrolls, or holy water) or an alchemist and want to buy alchemical items, your GM can give you permission to buy those, and she will tell you which items you can choose from and how much they cost.


        Once you’ve purchased your starting items, there are three main ways to gain new items and equipment: you can find them during an adventure, make them with the Crafting skill, or purchase them from a merchant.

        Though you might be able to barter valuable items in some areas, currency is the most versatile way to make transactions when you head to market. The most common currency is coin. For most commoners and beginning adventurers, the standard unit is the silver piece (sp). Each silver piece is of a standard weight of silver and is typically accepted by any merchant or kingdom no matter where it was minted. There are three other types of common coins, each likewise standardized in weight and value. The first is the copper piece (cp). Each copper piece is worth one-tenth of a silver piece. The gold piece (gp) is often used for purchasing magic items and other expensive items, as 1 gold piece is worth 10 silver pieces or 100 copper pieces. The platinum piece (pp) is used by nobles to demonstrate their wealth, for the purchase of very expensive items, or simply as a way to easily transport large sums of currency. A platinum piece is worth 10 gold pieces, 100 silver pieces, or 1,000 copper pieces. See Table 6–1: Coin Values for the exchange rates of common types of coins.

        Coins are popular due to their portability. A thousand coins of any denomination or combination of denominations count as 1 Bulk (see below). It’s not usually necessary to determine the Bulk of coins in fractions of 1,000. In other words, 100 coins don’t count as a light item, and 1,999 coins count as 1 Bulk, not 2.

        Most items in the following tables have a Price, which is the amount of currency it typically takes to purchase that item. However, some of the items listed have an inherent or otherwise meaningless cost, indicated with “—”. This typically indicates that an entry can’t be purchased. An item with a “0” Price indicates that it is normally free, but its value could be higher based on its quality or the composition of its materials. Most items can be sold for half their Price, but coins and raw materials (such as crafting components) can be exchanged for their full Price.

        Each item has an item level, which represents the complexity of the item and any magic used in its construction. Simpler items with a lower level are easier to construct, and you can’t Craft items that have a higher level than your own (see page 148). If an item’s level isn’t listed, its level is 0. While characters can use items of any level, Game Masters should keep in mind that allowing characters access to items far above their current level may imbalance the game.

        A character typically has two hands, allowing her to hold an item in each hand or a single two-handed item using both hands. Drawing or changing how you’re carrying an item usually requires an Interact action (dropping items instead uses the Drop action). Table 6–2: Changing Equipment lists some ways that you might change the items you’re holding or carrying, and the number of hands you need to do so. Many ways to use items cost multiple actions. For example, drinking a potion stowed in your belt pouch requires drawing it with an Interact action and drinking it with an Operate Activation action.

        Especially heavy or unwieldy items can make it more difficult for you to move swiftly, as can overloading yourself with too much gear. The Bulk value of an item reflects how difficult an item is to handle, representing both weight and the size of the item. In most cases, you don’t need to worry about Bulk unless you’re carrying numerous substantial items or you have a low Strength score.

        Items may have a number to indicate their Bulk value, or may be light (indicated by an L) or negligible for the purpose of determining Bulk (indicated by a —). For instance, full plate armor is 4 Bulk, a longsword is 1 Bulk, a dagger or scroll is light, and a piece of chalk is negligible. Ten light items count as 1 Bulk, and you don’t count fractions (so 9 light items count as 0, and 11 items count as 1). Items of negligible Bulk don’t count toward Bulk unless you try to carry vast numbers of them, as determined by the GM.

        As a general rule, an item that weighs 5 to 10 pounds is 1 Bulk, an item weighing less than a few ounces is negligible, and anything in between is light. Particularly awkward or unwieldy items might have different Bulk values. A 10-foot pole isn’t heavy, but its length makes it difficult for you to move while you have one on your person. Items made for larger or smaller creatures have greater or lesser Bulk, as described on page 191.

        An item can be destroyed if it takes damage enough times. An item reduces any damage dealt to it by its Hardness. The Hardness of various materials is explained in the Materials section on page 354. If an item takes damage equal to or exceeding the item’s Hardness, the item takes a Dent. If the item takes damage equal to or greater than twice its Hardness in one hit, it takes 2 Dents. For instance, a wooden shield (Hardness 3) that takes 10 damage would take 2 Dents. A typical item can take only 1 Dent without becoming broken. A second Dent causes it to become broken, though it can still be repaired. An item that would take a Dent or become broken while already broken is destroyed beyond salvage. Some magical or especially sturdy items can take more than 1 Dent before becoming broken, as noted in their descriptions.

        Broken is a condition that affects objects. A broken object can’t be used for its normal function, nor does it grant bonuses. It still imposes all penalties normally incurred by carrying, holding, or wearing it. For example, a suit of armor would still impose its Dexterity modifier cap, check penalty, and so forth. Broken armor is an exception. It still grants its item bonuses, but also gives you a conditional penalty to AC depending on its category: –1 for broken light armor, –2 for broken medium armor, or –3 for broken heavy armor.

Many objects are immune to most other conditions, at the GM’s discretion. For instance, a sword can’t be hampered, but some effects that cause the hampered condition might work on a moving blade trap. Intelligent items are not immune to mental effects.

        Your Armor Class (AC) measures how well you can defend against attacks. Your Touch Armor Class (TAC) protects against attacks that need only to touch you. Your Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity modifier (up to your armor’s Dexterity modifier cap) plus your proficiency modifier for any armor or shield you are using plus the armor’s item bonus to AC. If you’re using both armor and a shield, apply the lower of the two proficiency modifiers. If you’re not wearing armor, substitute your proficiency in unarmored defense. Your Touch Armor Class uses the same calculation, except you add your armor’s item bonus to TAC instead of its bonus to AC. Some spells, magic item, and abilities give your character a bonus or penalty to AC. These also apply to TAC unless stated otherwise.

The shield’s check penalty applies whenever you’re wielding the shield, regardless of whether the shield is raised.

        If you attack with a shield, treat it like an attack with an improvised weapon (see page 178). This deals the heavy shield bash damage or light shield bash damage (as appropriate to the shield’s type) listed on Table 6–5: Martial Melee Weapons on page 180.


        If you want to reliably use your shield to attack, you need to buy and attach a shield boss or shield spikes to the shield. These work like other weapons, and can even be etched with runes (see page 370).

        Most characters in Pathfinder likely carry some kind of weapon, whether a keen-edged dagger, a mighty warhammer, a graceful bow, or even a simple club. Full details on how you calculate your bonuses, penalties, and modifiers for attack rolls and damage rolls are given in Chapter 1 on page 17, but they are summarized here.

        When making an attack, determine the result of your attack roll by rolling a d20 and adding your attack modifier with the weapon or unarmed attack you’re using. Your melee attack modifier is the sum of your proficiency modifier with a weapon plus your Strength modifier (or optionally, your Dexterity modifier for weapons with the finesse trait). Your ranged attack modifier is the sum of your proficiency modifier with a weapon plus your Dexterity modifier. Bonuses and penalties apply to these rolls just like with other types of checks. Magic weapons and weapons of expert quality or better add an item bonus to your attack rolls.

        If you attack more than once on the same turn, your attacks after the first take a penalty called a multiple attack penalty. Your second attack takes a –5 penalty, and any subsequent attacks take a –10 penalty. This penalty is untyped and is cumulative with all other penalties. The penalty doesn’t apply to attacks you take when it isn’t your turn (such as attacks made as part of a reaction), though these attacks often have their own penalty. You can choose a weapon with the agile trait to reduce your multiple attack penalty (see page 182).

        You can Strike with your fist or another body part, calculating your attack and damage rolls in the same way you would with a weapon. This counts as a simple weapon, so almost all characters start out trained in unarmed attacks. Use the statistics for a fist even if you’re kicking, kneeing, or attacking with another part of your body. Some ancestry feats, class features, class feats, and spells give access to special, more powerful unarmed attacks.

        When the result of your attack roll with a weapon or unarmed attack is equal to or exceeds your target’s AC, roll the weapon or unarmed attack’s damage die to determine the damage you deal. If you’re making a melee attack, you add your Strength modifier to the damage. Ranged weapons usually use only the weapon’s damage die, though weapons with the propulsive trait sometimes add half your Strength modifier, and thrown weapons add your full Strength modifier.


        Magic weapons add one or more weapon damage dice to your damage roll. These extra dice are the same die size as the weapon’s damage die.

        When you make an attack and roll a natural 20 (the number on the die is 20), or if the result of your attack exceeds the target’s AC by 10, this is called a critical success (also known as a critical hit).


        If you critically succeed at a Strike, your attack deals double damage (see page 293). This damage doubling applies only on Strikes. Other attacks, such as spells or some uses of the Athletics skill, describe the specific effects that occur when their outcomes are critical successes.

        If you attack with something that wasn’t built to be a weapon, such as a chair or a vase, you’re making an attack with an improvised weapon. Treat it as a simple weapon of poor quality (regardless of its actual quality). The GM determines the amount and type of damage the attack deals, if any, as well as any weapon traits the improvised weapon should have. Many improvised weapons have the nonlethal trait.

        Characters who focus on combat need to carefully consider their choice of weapons, evaluating whether they want to fight in melee or at range, damage potential, and the special features of various weapons. Characters who are primarily spellcasters usually just need to pick a backup weapon in the best category they’re proficient with.

        When selecting weapons, you should start by identifying the weapon types that you have proficiency in. You should then compare weapons within these types to determine which ones you will have the highest melee or ranged attack modifier with. It’s usually considered best practice to select both a melee and ranged weapon during character creation so you can contend with a broader variety of foes.

        Ranged and thrown weapons have a range increment, indicated here in feet. Attacks with the weapon work normally up to that distance. Attacks beyond the weapon’s range increment take a –2 penalty for each additional multiple beyond. For example, a shortbow takes no penalty against a target up to 60 feet away, a –2 penalty against a target beyond 60 feet but up to 120 feet away, and a –4 penalty against a target beyond 120 feet but up to 180 feet away, and so on. Attacks that would take a penalty greater than –10 due to range are impossible.

        Ranged weapons indicate how many Interact actions it takes to reload them. This can be 0 if drawing ammunition and firing the weapon are part of the same action. If an item takes 2 or more actions to reload, the GM determines whether you can spend those actions out of sequence or if they must be performed together as an activity.


        An item with an entry of “—” must be drawn to be thrown, which usually takes an Interact action just like drawing any other weapon. Reloading and drawing a thrown weapon both require a free hand. When you spend the last action required to reload a weapon you’re holding, as part of that action, you can place your hands in the grip necessary to wield the weapon normally.

        Some weapons require one hand to use, and others require two. A few items, such as a bow, list 1+ for its hands entry. You can hold such a weapon in one hand, but the process of shooting it requires using another hand to retrieve, prepare, and shoot a piece of ammunition. This means you can do other things with your other hand while holding the bow in one hand without spending an action to change your grip, but you must free up your other hand in order to shoot. For example, you could shoot an arrow with your first action, use an Interact action to open a door with your second action, then shoot another arrow ^with your third action. You’re considered to be wielding a 1+ weapon as long as you’re holding it in one hand and also have a hand free.


        Weapons that require two hands typically deal more damage. Some weapons that use one hand have the two-hand trait, causing them to deal a different weapon damage die when used in two hands.


        In addition, some abilities require you to be wielding a weapon in two hands. You meet this requirement as long as you hold the weapon in two hands, even if it doesn’t actually require two hands or have the two-hand trait.

        An attached weapon must be combined with another piece of gear in order to be used. The trait lists what type of item the weapon must be attached to. You must be wielding or wearing the item the weapon is attached to in order to attack with it. For example, shield spikes are attached to a shield, allowing you to attack with the spikes instead of a shield bash, but only if you’re wielding the shield. An attached weapon is usually bolted onto or built into the item it’s attached to, and typically an item can have only one weapon attached to it. An attached weapon can be removed from one item and attached to another with successful use of the Crafting skill. If an item is destroyed, its attached weapon can usually be salvaged.

You can’t attack with a free-hand weapon if you’re wielding anything in that hand or using the hand for something else. When you’re not wielding anything and not using the hand, you can use abilities that require you to have a hand free as well as those that require you to be wielding a weapon in that hand.

        These weapons are used as a pair, each complementing the other. When you are wielding two of the same weapon with this trait and attack with one of them, if you already attacked with the other weapon this turn, you add a circumstance bonus to the damage roll equal to the weapon’s number of damage dice. For instance, if you attacked with a twin weapon in your right hand with your first action, you would gain this bonus to damage when you attack with a matching twin weapon in your left hand for your second action. On your third action, an attack with either weapon would receive this bonus, since you’d already attacked with both. The weapons must be of the same type to benefit from this trait, but they don’t need to be the same quality or have the same runes.

        These four-pronged metal spikes can cause damage to a creature’s feet. You can scatter caltrops in an empty square adjacent to you with an Interact action. The first creature that moves into that square must succeed at a DC 14 Acrobatics check or take 1d4 piercing damage and 1 persistent bleed damage. A creature taking bleed damage from caltrops is hampered 5. Spending an Interact action to pluck the caltrops free reduces the DC to stop the bleeding. Once a creature takes damage from caltrops, enough caltrops are ruined that other creatures moving into the square are safe.


        Deployed caltrops can be salvaged to be used again if no creatures took damage from them. Otherwise, enough caltrops are ruined that they can’t be salvaged.

        A lantern sheds bright light and requires 1 pint of oil to function for 6 hours. A bull’s-eye lantern emits its light in a 60-foot cone. A hooded lantern sheds light in a 30-foot radius and is equipped with shutters, which you can close to block the light. Closing or opening the shutters takes an Interact action and requires you to have one hand free.

        Binding a creature in manacles requires one successful touch attack to bind each wrist or ankle. A creature is normally untrained with manacle touch attacks. A two- legged creature with its legs bound is hampered 15, and a two-handed creature with its wrists bound has to succeed at a DC 5 flat check any time it uses a manipulate action or else that action fails. A creature bound to a stationary object is immobile. For creatures with more or fewer limbs, the GM determines what effect manacles have, if any. Freeing a creature from manacles requires three successful DC 22 Thievery checks to Pick the Lock. Expert-quality manacles require four successes at DC 27, and master- quality manacles require five successes at DC 32.

A poor-quality suit of armor also worsens the armor’s check penalty by 2. If a poor-quality item takes enough damage to gain a Dent, it is broken instead.

        Weapons and skill-boosting items of expert, master, and legendary quality add the listed item bonus to attack rolls with the weapon or skill checks using the item (see Table 6–19). Higher-quality armor reduces its check penalty by an amount equal to the item bonus (so master-quality hide would have a –1 check penalty instead of the standard –3 check penalty). As with other item bonuses, you apply only the higher item bonus from the item’s quality or its magic.

        Weapons that shoot ammunition convey their bonuses and abilities onto their ammunition, so an attack roll using standard-quality ammunition and an expert-quality bow still gains a +1 item bonus. You can also purchase high- quality ammunition—10 pieces of ammunition cost as much as a single weapon. Magic ammunition has special benefits, but attacking with high-quality nonmagical ammunition doesn’t confer any special bonus or benefit, so using expert-quality ammunition with a standard bow does not provide any bonus to the attack roll.

        While most items can be purchased at a better quality level for an increased Price, few actually grant any benefit from this improvement. Those that offer a benefit for improved quality list their Price and bonuses in their description. A finely crafted jeweled lantern, for example, is no better at providing light than an ordinary lantern, even if it is worth 100 sp.

        You can use the Craft downtime activity (see page 148) to improve the quality of an item up to your proficiency rank in the Crafting skill. For this purpose, the Price equals the difference in Price between the two qualities. Upgrading an expert-quality chain shirt to master quality, for example, uses a Price of 3,250 sp. This requires you to have master Crafting and to provide 1,625 sp worth of raw materials to start the process.


        Nonmagical items might decrease in quality over a long period of neglect or after extended use, but they can be restored in the same way as improving an item.

        Weapons and armor must be expert quality or better to be made into a magic item. Quality determines the maximum bonus and number of properties the weapon or armor can have. The full rules for magic items begin on page 376.


        Magic items are always assumed to be the minimum level of quality for their bonus unless noted otherwise, and the quality cost is included in the item’s Price. Rarely, an item will be of a higher quality than the bonus would indicate, with its Price increased by the difference in quality. A +1 legendary longsword, for example, would cost 64,650 sp more than an ordinary +1 longsword (which would normally be crafted at an expert level).

Structures, such as walls and doors, gain twice as much Hardness for higher quality, as shown on the table.

        The Bulk rules in this chapter are made for Small and Medium creatures, and similarly the items are sized for creatures of those sizes. Large or larger creatures can carry more, and Tiny creatures can carry less. Their Bulk limits are multiplied, as noted on the table below.


        In most cases, the only creatures of sizes other than Small or Medium are monsters under the GM control, in which case you probably won’t need to track Bulk carefully. These rules for Bulk limits mainly come up when a group tries to load up a mount or animal companion, and the rules for items of different sizes apply when the characters defeat a big creature that has gear, like a fire giant.

        Creatures of different sizes count items of lower or higher Bulk in a similar way to how Small and Medium creatures count light items, as shown in the table. For example, a Large creature counts 10 items of 1 Bulk as 1 Bulk and a Huge creature counts 10 items of 2 Bulk as 1 Bulk. A Tiny creature counts 10 items of negligible Bulk as 1 Bulk. Negligible items work in a similar way—a Huge creature can carry any number of 1-Bulk items. A Tiny creature doesn’t count any items as negligible Bulk.

        Creatures of sizes other than Small or Medium need items appropriate to their size. These items have different Bulk, and possibly a different Price. The table below provides the differences. Items that are always built for creatures of a certain size (such as the barding on page 189) already include any necessary adjustments.


        For example, a morningstar has a Price of 10 sp and 1 Bulk, so one made for a Huge creature has a Price of 40 sp and 4 Bulk. One made for a Tiny creature still costs 10 sp (due to its intricacy) and has 1/2 Bulk, which converts to light Bulk. A torch costs 1 cp and has light Bulk, so a torch made for a Huge creature costs 4 cp and has 2 Bulk, and one made for a Tiny creature costs 1 cp and has negligible Bulk.


        A Tiny creature or one that’s Large or larger counts items of different Bulk in a special way, as described on above. This means these creatures can usually wear and carry about the same amount of gear as a Medium creature if the equipment is appropriately sized.


        The Price adjustment applies only to the Price of the item itself. Prices for magic items and alchemical items mostly come from their magic or alchemical properties. The Price of an item made from special materials is calculated based on the item’s Bulk, after adjusting the Bulk for the item’s size. See Chapter 11 for more  information.
