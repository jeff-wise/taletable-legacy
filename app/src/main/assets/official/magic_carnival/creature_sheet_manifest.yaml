    A circus performer as a kid and a pirate as a teengaer, Casmey is now a reluctant adult looking for a
    new adventure. That shouldn't be hard though -- she's always been quite talented at finding trouble. Since her days
    on the trapeze, she's been most comfortable perched in precarious situations, where a tiny mistake
    leads to a painful fall. When she does fall -- and she has many times -- she tends
    to land on her feet, ready to climb back up.
