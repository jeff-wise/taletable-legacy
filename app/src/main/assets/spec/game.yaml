    Tome is an application for creating and playing roleplaying games. The heart of Tome 
    is a programmable roleplaying engine that allows users to program game mechanics, create 
    items, spells, etc... and design interactive, playable templates for their game. The Tome 
    app includes a customizable layout so the entire experience of a roleplaying game can be 
    built and customized within Tome. Furthermore, all of that work can easily be distributed 
    and shared with players.
