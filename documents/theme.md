make an app for people who prefer paper and dice!

designed to aid the roleplay experience. not just be a fancy form.
want an app that actual enchanced roleplaying, not just documenting
game mechanics.

Also want app that enchances understanding of game mechanics, because
oftentimes it seems ad hoc, too complicated, or you forget what to add
when. decide what to add ahead of time and then go with that at time
of combat.
